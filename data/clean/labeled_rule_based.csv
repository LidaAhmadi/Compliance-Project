0,"The People of the State of New York, respondent, v Nicholas Palm, appellant.","appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the county court, orange county (craig s. brown, j.), rendered may 16, 2023, convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. the appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. 

ordered that the judgment is affirmed. the defendant was arrested after a stop and frisk resulting in the recovery of a firearm. after a hearing, the county court denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress the physical evidence recovered, including the firearm, and the defendant's statements made to law enforcement officials. after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. 

the defendant appeals. pursuant to people v de bour ( 40 ny2d 210 ), there is ""a graduated four-level test for evaluating the propriety of police encounters when a police officer is acting in a law enforcement capacity"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d 869 , 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see people v alleyne , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01941 ). ""the first level permits a police officer to request information from an individual, and merely requires that the request be supported by an objective, credible reason, not necessarily indicative of criminality"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""the second level, known as the common-law right of inquiry, requires a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, and permits a somewhat greater intrusion"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, the subject may be asked to produce identification, may be asked whether he [or she] has weapons, and may be asked to remove his [or her] hands from his [or her] pockets"" ( matter of shakir j. , 119 ad3d 792, 794-795 [citation omitted]; see people v alleyne , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01941 ; people v muhammed , 196 ad3d 1151 , 1152-1153). ""the third level permits a police officer to forcibly stop and detain an individual"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""such a detention, however, is not permitted unless there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""a corollary of the statutory right to temporarily detain for questioning is the authority to frisk if the officer reasonably suspects that he [or she] is in danger of physical injury by virtue of the detainee being armed"" ( people v de bour , 40 ny2d at 223 ). ""the fourth level authorizes an arrest based on probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

here, in light of the evidence demonstrating that the defendant matched the general description of the perpetrator, who had brandished a firearm, that was broadcast over the police radio, along with the defendant's temporal and spatial proximity to the scene of that incident, and the officers' observations that the defendant put his hands in his waistband, the police had reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the defendant ( see people v de bour , 40 ny2d at 223 ; people v alleyne , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01941 ; people v richardson , 219 ad3d 637 , 638; people v maschoun , 186 ad3d 1402 , 1403; people v currie , 131 ad3d 1265 ; people v abdul-mateen , 126 ad3d 986, 988 ). to the extent that 

the defendant contends that introducing his statements made to law enforcement officials violated his miranda rights ( see miranda v arizona , 384 us 436 ), the evidence at the hearing established that the statements were made spontaneously and were not the product of police interrogation or its functional equivalent ( see people v martinez , 186 ad3d 1530 , 1531; people v barnes , 171 ad3d 1082 , 1082). 

accordingly, the county court properly denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. the defendant's contention that penal law ยง 265.03 is unconstitutional in light of the decision in new york state rifle & pistol assn., inc. v bruen ( 597 us 1 ) is unpreserved for appellate review, as the defendant failed to raise a constitutional challenge before the county court ( see people v robb , 233 ad3d 805 ; people v bynum , 225 ad3d 781 , 781; people v chase , 223 ad3d 913 , 913). in any event, the bruen decision ""had no impact on the constitutionality of new york state's criminal possession of a weapon statutes"" ( people v manners , 217 ad3d 683 , 686; see people v sargeant , 230 ad3d 1341 , 1355; people v chase , 223 ad3d at 913). the defendant's contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel is without merit. under both the state and federal standards for ineffective assistance of counsel, ""[t]here can be no denial of effective assistance . . . arising from counsel's failure to make a motion or argument that has little or no chance of success"" ( people v caban , 5 ny3d 143, 152 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see people v parvez , 209 ad3d 885 , 887; people v clark , 171 ad3d 942 , 944; see also people v kamara , 234 ad3d 496 , 497). the defendant's remaining contention is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, without merit.",high,['ineffective assistance of counsel']
1,"Maria Airene Pantanilla, respondent, v Guillerma Yuson, appellant.","in an action, in effect, to recover damages for money had and received and unjust enrichment, the defendant appeals from a judgment of the supreme court, nassau county (dawn jimenez, j.), dated march 17, 2023. the judgment, upon an order of the same court entered march 15, 2023, granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to enter a default judgment, is in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. 

ordered that the judgment is affirmed, with costs. on december 2, 2021, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant, alleging that the plaintiff and the defendant reached an agreement pursuant to which the plaintiff would purchase the defendant's grocery store and restaurant for $440,940. in consideration of that agreement, the plaintiff made installment payments totaling $40,000 to the defendant. the plaintiff alleged that the defendant rescinded the agreement and did not return the sum of $40,000. the plaintiff asserted, in effect, causes of action to recover damages for money had and received and unjust enrichment. on december 7, 2021, the plaintiff served the defendant with the summons and complaint. on december 22, 2021, the defendant's counsel filed a notice of appearance. thereafter, the defendant failed to answer the complaint. in december 2022, the plaintiff moved for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant. by order entered march 15, 2023, the supreme court granted the plaintiff's motion. on march 17, 2023, a judgment, upon the order, was entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. 

the defendant appeals. ""'on a motion for leave to enter a default judgment against a defendant based on the failure to answer or appear, a plaintiff must submit proof of service of the summons and complaint, proof of the facts constituting the cause of action, and proof of the defendant's default'"" ( nationstar mtge., llc v gross , 201 ad3d 942 , 944, quoting l & z masonry corp. v mose , 167 ad3d 728 , 729; see cplr 3215[f]). ""since defaulters are deemed to have admitted all factual allegations contained in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that flow from them, when submitting proof of facts constituting a claim, a plaintiff need only set forth enough facts to enable the supreme court to determine that the plaintiff alleged a viable cause of action"" ( rosenzweig v gubner , 194 ad3d 1086 , 1088 [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]; see global liberty ins. co. v haar orthopaedics & sports med., p.c. , 170 ad3d 1125 , 1126). ""to defeat a facially sufficient cplr 3215 motion, a defendant must show either that there was no default, or that it had a reasonable excuse for its delay and a potentially meritorious defense"" ( national loan invs., l.p. v bruno , 191 ad3d 999 , 1001; see u.s. bank n.a. v crockett , 201 ad3d 767 , 768). 

here, in support of her motion for leave to enter a default judgment, the plaintiff made the required showing by submitting proof of service of the summons and complaint, proof of the facts constituting the causes of action, and proof of the defendant's default. in opposition, the defendant contended that she was not in default because her counsel served a notice of appearance. however, service of a notice of appearance does not ""'absolve a defendant from complying with the time restrictions imposed by cplr 320(a) which govern the service of an answer or the making of a motion pursuant to cplr 3211'"" ( 21st mtge. corp. v raghu , 197 ad3d 1212 , 1216, quoting deutsche bank natl. trust co. v hall , 185 ad3d 1006 , 1009-1010; see cplr 320(a); 3211). similarly, the defendant's contention that her failure to timely answer should be excused because the plaintiff did not respond to the demand for service of the summons and complaint in the notice of appearance is without merit, since the plaintiff had already properly served a summons and complaint ( see cplr 320[a], [b]; 3211[a][8]; travelon, inc. v maekitan , 215 ad3d 710 , 713-714; 21st mtge. corp. v raghu , 197 ad3d at 1216). the defendant's contention that her default should be excused due to law office failure is improperly raised for the first time on appeal ( see matter of regina metro. co., llc v new york state div. of hous. & community renewal , 35 ny3d 332 , 362-363; crudele v price , 218 ad3d 534 , 536). in light of the defendant's failure to establish a reasonable excuse for her default, it is unnecessary to determine whether she demonstrated a potentially meritorious defense ( see u.s. bank n.a. v carucci , 217 ad3d 894 , 895; wells fargo bank, n.a. v eliacin , 206 ad3d 950 , 952). the defendant's remaining contention is without merit.

2,"Franklin Carroll, LLC, appellant, v Carroll Development Plaza, LLC, respondent.","in an action, inter alia, for injunctive relief and to recover damages for trespass, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the supreme court, kings county (carolyn e. wade, j.), dated february 27, 2024. the order denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and, in effect, granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, among other things, to access the plaintiff's real property, subject to certain conditions. 

ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs. the plaintiff and the defendant own adjacent real properties located in brooklyn. in 2019, in furtherance of the defendant's plan to construct a building on its property, the parties entered into a license agreement. the plaintiff agreed to permit the defendant to access the plaintiff's property and to install ""temporary protections"" on the plaintiff's property, including, monitoring equipment, a construction fence on the lot line, and a construction shed and scaffold in the plaintiff's rear yard. in consideration, the defendant agreed, inter alia, to pay to the plaintiff a monthly licensing fee, commencing upon the installation of the temporary protections. the defendant deposited with the plaintiff's attorney licensing fees for the first six months, to be held in escrow. however, the defendant's project was delayed and it is undisputed that the term of the license agreement expired on october 22, 2021, without the defendant ever having entered upon the plaintiff's property. the funds held in escrow were not returned to the defendant. in 2023, the parties attempted to negotiate a new license agreement, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. nevertheless, in september 2023, the defendant entered upon the plaintiff's property and installed temporary protections. the defendant then began construction of its building. on or about january 24, 2024, the plaintiff commenced this action, among other things, for an injunction directing the defendant to remove the temporary protections and to refrain from entering upon the plaintiff's property and to recover damages for trespass. the following day, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. invoking rpapl 881, the defendant cross-moved for a license, inter alia, to access the plaintiff's property. the supreme court granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, upon certain specified conditions, including the payment of monthly licensing fees as set forth in the 2019 license agreement, with a credit for the fees already paid, and requirements that the defendant name the plaintiff as an additional insured on its commercial general liability insurance policy and repair any physical damage to the plaintiff's property caused by the defendant's access. the court also denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. the plaintiff appeals. rpapl 881 allows an owner of real property planning to make improvements thereon to seek a license to enter the premises of an adjoining owner when such entry is necessary to make the improvements and the adjoining owner has refused such access ( see id. ; matter of voron v board of mgrs. of newswalk condominium , 186 ad3d 833 , 834). in determining whether to grant a license pursuant to rpapl 881, the court may consider the following factors: ""the nature and extent of the requested access, the duration of the access, the protections to the adjoining property that are needed, the lack of an alternative means to perform the work, the public interest in the completion of the project, and the measures in place to ensure the financial compensation of the adjoining owner for any damage or inconvenience resulting from the intrusion"" ( matter of voron v board of mgrs. of newswalk condominium , 186 ad3d at 835; see matter of queens coll. special projects fund, inc. v newman , 154 ad3d 943, 944 ). in general, ""[c]ourts are required to balance the interests of the parties and should issue a license when necessary, under reasonable conditions, and where the inconvenience to the adjacent property owner is relatively slight compared to the hardship of his [or her] neighbor if the license is refused"" ( matter of voron v board of mgrs. of newswalk condominium , 186 ad3d at 835 [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

here, the supreme court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in issuing a license to the defendant with specified conditions. the defendant's evidence demonstrated that the temporary protections would be in place for no more than 12 months and were necessary for the defendant to construct its building while protecting the plaintiff's property in accordance with the requirements of the new york city building code ( see matter of queens coll. special projects fund, inc. v newman , 154 ad3d at 944 ). further, the plaintiff would be protected financially by the defendant's payment of substantial monthly licensing fees, being named as an additional insured on the defendant's insurance policy, and the defendant's payment for any physical damage to the plaintiff's property ( see id. ; matter of voron v board of mgrs. of newswalk condominium , 186 ad3d at 835). in opposition to the defendant's showing, the plaintiff did not submit any evidence, such as an opposing expert affidavit, to show that, or to raise any triable issues of fact as to whether, the temporary protections were unnecessary or unreasonable or that the balance of the parties' interests required denial of the license. further, as no triable issues of fact were raised, the plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing on the defendant's request for a license ( see rpapl 881; cplr 409). contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the supreme court's granting of a license did not serve to excuse, after the fact, the defendant's trespass on the plaintiff's property. the license was not granted nunc pro tunc to the defendant's entry onto the plaintiff's property in september 2023. nor was such relief requested by the defendant. thus, the defendant's use of the plaintiff's property was licensed only as of the issuance of the court's order. contrary to the plaintiff's further contention, in issuing the license, the supreme court had the authority to impose ""such terms as justice requires,"" including the terms to which the parties had previously agreed in the 2019 license agreement (rpapl 881). the conditions imposed by the court were not an improvident exercise of its discretion. the supreme court also did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. ""although the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial, the remedy is considered a drastic one, which should be used sparingly"" ( soundview cinemas, inc. v ac i soundview, llc , 149 ad3d 1121, 1123 ). ""to obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant must establish (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction, and (3) a balancing of the equities in the movant's favor"" ( samaha v brooklyn bridge park corp. , 230 ad3d 608 , 610 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see cplr 6301). 

here, while the plaintiff showed a likelihood of success on its cause of action to recover damages for the past trespass ( see umlas v britton , 222 ad3d 1031 , 1032; shrage v con edison co. , 216 ad3d 1023 , 1025-1026), it is not likely to succeed on its cause of action for an injunction in light of the order granting the defendant's cross-motion for a license ( see spatafore v u.s. bank trust n.a. , 231 ad3d 985 , 986). furthermore, even absent the granting of the license, at the point when the plaintiff made its motion, the balance of the equities favored the defendant. among other things, the defendant demonstrated that removal of the temporary protections at that time would have endangered the plaintiff's property, the occupants of the property, and the general public. further, the defendant accessed the plaintiff's property under conditions to which the plaintiff had previously agreed and for which it had been partially paid. under the circumstances, even without considering the license granted to the defendant in the order, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to a preliminary injunction ( see soundview cinemas, inc. v ac i soundview, llc , 149 ad3d at 1124 ). the parties' remaining contentions are either without merit or not properly before this court as they are based on matter dehors the record. 

accordingly, we affirm the order appealed from.",low,[]

here, in light of the parties' conflicting allegations as to whether there was an ""intimate relationship"" between the child and the respondent within the meaning of family court act ยง 812(1)(e), the family court, prior to determining whether it had subject matter jurisdiction, should have conducted a hearing on that issue ( see matter of rizzo v pravato , 170 ad3d at 862; matter of gustavo d. v michael d. , 146 ad3d 530 ; matter of singh v difrancisco , 141 ad3d 598, 598 ).

the defendant appeals. the supreme court properly denied the defendant's cross-motion for leave to renew her opposition to those branches of the plaintiff's prior motion which were for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against her and for an order of reference, since the defendant failed to demonstrate that there had been a change in the law that would have altered the prior determination ( see cplr 2221[e][2]; u.s. bank trust, n.a. v mccobb , 222 ad3d 696 ). in any event, contrary to the defendant's contention, the business records on which the plaintiff's assistant vice president relied in attesting to the defendant's default in payment were attached to the affidavit of the assistant vice president, and the records themselves evinced the defendant's default ( see citigroup v kopelowitz , 147 ad3d 1014, 1015 ). further, the supreme court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. contrary to the defendant's contention, the failure of the referee to conduct a hearing does not require reversal of the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale, as the defendant had the opportunity to raise questions and submit relevant evidence to the court ( see u.s. bank n.a. v mays , 221 ad3d 934 , 935; wilmington trust, n.a. v reed , 210 ad3d 731 , 732). moreover, the referee's findings with respect to the total amount due upon the mortgage were substantially supported by the record ( see wilmington trust, n.a. v reed , 210 ad3d at 732).",low,[]

(one as to each child), all dated april 30, 2024. the orders of fact-finding and disposition, after fact-finding and dispositional hearings, found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the subject children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the subject children to the petitioner and the commissioner of the administration for children's services of the city of new york for the purpose of adoption. 

ordered that the orders of fact-finding and disposition are affirmed, without costs or disbursements. the petitioner, mercyfirst (hereinafter the agency), commenced these proceedings to terminate the parental rights of the mother and the father to the subject children on the ground of permanent neglect. following fact-finding and dispositional hearings, the family court found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the children to the agency and the commissioner of the administration for children's services of the city of new york for the purpose of adoption. the mother and the father separately appeal. ""when a foster care agency brings a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the ground of permanent neglect, it must, as a threshold matter, prove by clear and convincing evidence that it has fulfilled its statutory duty to exercise diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parent-child relationship"" ( matter of shimon g. [batsheva g.] , 206 ad3d 732 , 733 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see matter of naijah-s.g.b. [thomas x.b.] , 230 ad3d 1314 , 1314). ""those efforts must include counseling, making suitable arrangements for parental access, providing assistance to the parents to resolve the problems preventing the child's discharge, and advising the parents of the child's progress and development"" ( matter of christopher c. [sonia c.] , 235 ad3d 865 , 856 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see matter of shimon g. [batsheva g.] , 206 ad3d at 733). once the agency demonstrates that it made diligent efforts to strengthen the parental relationship, it bears the burden of proving ""by clear and convincing evidence, that for a period of one year following the child's placement with the agency, the parent failed to maintain contact with the child or, alternatively, failed to plan for the future of the child, although physically and financially able to do so"" ( matter of daniel j.l.

[batsheva g.] , 206 ad3d at 733). 

here, the agency met its burden of establishing that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children. the agency demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that it made diligent efforts to strengthen each parent's relationship with the children by formulating a service plan that served each parent's needs, providing referrals to programs, explaining the importance of compliance with the service plan, and facilitating parental access between the parents and the children. moreover, the record shows that the parents failed to plan for the children's futures, despite the agency's diligent efforts, as they only partially complied with their service plans ( see matter of damaris e.a. [johanna a.m.] , 217 ad3d 860 , 861; matter of shimon g. [batsheva g.] , 206 ad3d at 734). 

accordingly, the family court properly found that the parents permanently neglected the children. the evidence adduced at the dispositional hearing established that termination of the parental rights of the mother and the father was in the best interests of the children ( see matter of abbygail h.m.g. [eddie g.] , 205 ad3d 913 , 914; matter of elizabeth m.g.c.

[maria l.g.c.] , 190 ad3d at 732; see matter of abbygail h.m.g.

here, the plaintiff failed to establish that wmc had actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim, failed to provide a reasonable excuse, and failed to establish that it would not substantially prejudice wmc in its defense if the late notice were allowed. 

accordingly, the supreme court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was for leave to serve a late notice of claim. moreover, even assuming that the plaintiff satisfied general municipal law ยง 50-e(5), she then had one year and 90 days after the toll on the statute of limitations was lifted, or until february 2, 2022, to commence this action but did not do so until march 4, 2022, 30 days after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. therefore, the supreme court properly granted wmc's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was time-barred. the plaintiff's remaining contentions are improperly raised for the first time on appeal.",low,[]

m. doherty (hereinafter together the greenwald defendants). the plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the defendants colluded with each other to conceal the alleged authentic version of the lindeman report and to present a fraudulent report that resulted in the plaintiff's removal as voluntary library trustee. thereafter, the frishberg defendants and the mccabe defendants separately moved pursuant to cplr 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them on the grounds, inter alia, that the action was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. in addition, the greenwald defendants moved pursuant to cplr 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against them on those grounds and to enjoin the plaintiff ""from filing any further actions relating to her claim that the lindeman report exchange in her underlying action was fraudulent."" in an order dated february 8, 2021, the supreme court, among other things, granted the motions of the frishberg defendants, the mccabe defendants, and the greenwald defendants, and, sua sponte, in effect, directed the dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the sussman defendants and the goldberg defendants. the plaintiff appeals. ""collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue clearly raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party or those in privity, whether or not the tribunals or causes of action are the same"" ( reid v reid , 198 ad3d 993 , 994). ""'the two requirements for its application are: first, the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive in the present action, and second, the party to be precluded must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination'"" ( cullen v moschetta , 207 ad3d 699 , 700, quoting matter of abady , 22 ad3d 71, 81 ). ""'the party seeking to invoke collateral estoppel has the burden to show the identity of the issues, while the party trying to avoid application of the doctrine must establish the lack of a full and fair opportunity to litigate'"" ( villaver v paglinawan , 230 ad3d 533 , 535, quoting matter of dunn , 24 ny3d 699, 704 ). 

here, the majority of the plaintiff's allegations in this action were premised on her claim that the lindeman report was a forgery and that an authentic report existed that made findings in her favor. however, the supreme court, in the defamation action, determined that jamieson's statements regarding the substance of the lindeman report were accurate, including that lindeman found that jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible and that the plaintiff should be removed as voluntary library trustee if she declined to resign or receive managerial training. thus, the moving defendants established that the accuracy of the lindeman report, which the plaintiff challenges in this action, had been necessarily decided against her in the defamation action ( see gold v rothfeld , 220 ad3d 717 , 718; manko v gabay , 175 ad3d 484 , 486). in opposition, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that she lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue ( see mortgage elec. registration sys., inc. v mcvicar , 203 ad3d 919 , 920; demartino v lomonaco , 155 ad3d 686, 687 ). furthermore, to the extent the plaintiff raised allegations that were not precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the supreme court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. ""'on a motion to dismiss pursuant to cplr 3211(a)(7), the complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction, the facts alleged are presumed to be true, the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of every favorable inference, and the court is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory'"" ( clevenger v yuzek , 222 ad3d 931 , 934, quoting gorbatov v tsirelman , 155 ad3d 836, 837 ). pursuant to judiciary law ยง 487, an attorney who is ""guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party"" is liable to the injured party for treble damages ( see guliyev v banilov & assoc., p.c. , 221 ad3d 589 , 591). ""'a violation of judiciary law ยง 487 requires an intent to deceive'"" ( id. , quoting moormann v perini & hoerger , 65 ad3d 1106, 1108 ). ""'allegations regarding an act of deceit or intent to deceive must be stated with particularity'"" ( guliyev v banilov & assoc., p.c. , 221 ad3d at 591, quoting bill birds, inc. v stein law firm, p.c. , 164 ad3d 635 , 637, affd 25 ny3d 173 ). further, ""'an injury to the plaintiff resulting from the alleged deceitful conduct of the defendant attorney is an essential element of a cause of action based on a violation' of judiciary law ยง 487"" ( maroulis v sari m. friedman, p.c. , 153 ad3d 1250, 1252 [alteration omitted], quoting rozen v russ & russ, p.c. , 76 ad3d 965 , 968). ""thus, to state a cause of action alleging a violation of judiciary law ยง 487, the plaintiff must 'plead allegations from which damages attributable to the defendants' conduct might be reasonably inferred'"" ( maroulis v sari m. friedman, p.c. , 153 ad3d at 1252 , quoting mizuno v nunberg , 122 ad3d 594, 595 ). 

here, the plaintiff failed to allege sufficiently specific facts from which it could be reasonably inferred either that the defendants acted with the requisite degree of scienter or that the alleged acts of deceit were the proximate cause of any injury to the plaintiff ( see pinkesz mut. holdings, llc v pinkesz , 198 ad3d 693 , 697-698; sammy v haupel , 170 ad3d 1224 , 1225). furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, the supreme court providently exercised its discretion in granting that branch of the greenwald defendants' motion which was for certain injunctive relief to the extent of enjoining the plaintiff from commencing any new action pertaining to her removal as voluntary library trustee without prior written permission of the court ( see monaco v van meerendonk , 222 ad3d 744 ). while ""public policy mandates free access to the courts,"" ""a litigant can forfeit that right by[, as 

here,] abusing the judicial process through vexatious litigation"" ( rossrock fund ii, l.p. v toledo , 186 ad3d 1441 , 1442 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see caesar v hsbc bank usa, na , 200 ad3d 842 , 843). the parties' remaining contentions either need not be reached in light of our determination or are without merit.",low,[]
14,"Nebesia Walker-Little, appellant, v Westchester Medical Center, respondent.","in a proceeding pursuant to family court act article 6, the maternal grandfather appeals, and the subject child separately appeals, from an order of the family court, suffolk county (cheryl m. helfer, ct. atty. ref.), dated june 24, 2024. the order, after a hearing, denied the maternal grandfather's petition for custody of the subject child and dismissed the proceeding. 

ordered that the order is reversed, on the facts and in the exercise of discretion, without costs or disbursements, and the matter is remitted to the family court, suffolk county, for a hearing to determine a custody award based upon the best interests of the subject child. the mother and the father have one child together, born in 2009. in 2014 or 2015, the father voluntarily left the child in the care of the mother, who was residing in the maternal grandfather's household. between 2015 and 2018, the father was incarcerated but maintained some contact with the child. after the father's release, he assisted the mother and the child with moving out of the maternal grandfather's household, but the father continued to live apart from the mother and the child. the maternal grandfather continued assisting the mother in caring for the child and saw the child almost every day. in 2020, the father moved into a house near the maternal grandfather's residence, and the child started staying with the father overnight on a weekly basis. in june 2023, the mother was involved in a car accident and subsequently died from her injuries. on the night of the accident, a paternal uncle drove the child to the maternal grandfather's house, as the father was visiting his fiancรฉe in north carolina, where he had been planning to relocate without the child. in july 2023, after the mother's death, the father decided to bring the child to north carolina with him. after ascertaining the child's wishes, the maternal grandfather commenced this proceeding for custody of the child. after a hearing, in an order dated june 24, 2024, the family court denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding, determining that the maternal grandfather failed to establish the existence of extraordinary circumstances. the maternal grandfather and the child separately appeal. ""pursuant to domestic relations law ยง 72(2)(a), a grandparent has standing to seek custody of a child where the grandparent demonstrates the existence of extraordinary circumstances, such as 'surrender, abandonment, persisting neglect, unfitness, and unfortunate or involuntary disruption of custody over an extended period of time,' 'or other like extraordinary circumstances'"" ( matter of seltzer v patterson , 193 ad3d 1057 , 1058 [citation omitted], quoting matter of bennett v jeffreys , 40 ny2d 543, 544, 546 ). an ""extended disruption of custody"" between the child and the parent ""shall constitute an extraordinary circumstance"" (domestic relations law ยง 72[2][a]). ""the statute defines 'extended disruption of custody' as including, but not limited to, 'a prolonged separation of the respondent parent and the child for at least twenty-four continuous months during which the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child and the child resided in the household of the petitioner grandparent or grandparents'"" ( matter of mooney v mooney , 198 ad3d 784 , 785-786, quoting domestic relations law ยง 72[2][b]). ""however, the statute does not preclude a court from finding the existence of extraordinary circumstances even if the prolonged separation lasted less than 24 months"" ( id. at 786). ""moreover, lack of contact is not a separate element under th[e] statute, '[r]ather, the quality and quantity of contact between the parent and child are simply factors to be considered in the context of the totality of the circumstances when determining whether the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child, and whether the child actually resided with the grandparents for the required ""prolonged"" period of time'"" ( id. , quoting matter of suarez v williams , 26 ny3d 440, 449 ). ""'inasmuch as the family court is in the best position to evaluate the credibility, temperament, and sincerity of the parties, its determination should be set aside only if it lacks a sound and substantial basis in the record'"" ( matter of seltzer v patterson , 193 ad3d at 1058, quoting matter of gonzalez v pagan , 178 ad3d 1039 , 1040). 

here, contrary to the family court's determination, the maternal grandfather sustained his burden of demonstrating the existence of extraordinary circumstances. the evidence at the hearing established that, even though the father had regular contact and parental access with the child, the maternal grandparents have taken care of the child for most of her life and provided her with stability. additionally, the father allowed the mother and the maternal grandparents to assume control over, and responsibility for the care of, the child while the father assumed the role of a noncustodial parent, the child has developed a close relationship with her half-siblings and extended family in new york, and the child expressed a desire to continue residing with the maternal grandfather ( see matter of tuttle v worthington , 219 ad3d 1142 , 1145; matter of mumford v milner , 183 ad3d 893 , 895). 

accordingly, since the family court did not reach the issue of whether an award of custody to the maternal grandfather was in the best interests of the child, a hearing is required to determine a custody award based upon the best interests of the child ( see matter of elisa f. v daniel d. , 225 ad3d 695 , 697).",medium,['best interests of the child']

ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs to the defendants-respondents. the plaintiff's decedent, debbie durham, was a passenger in a vehicle owned by durham and operated by the defendant roland tucker (hereinafter the host vehicle) when it collided with a taxi operated by the defendant thomas giordano and owned by the defendant southampton management, inc. the collision occurred on sills road, which was a two-way street with two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. tucker was operating the host vehicle straight in the left northbound lane. giordano exited from a driveway of a premises located on the west side of sills road, crossed the two southbound lanes, and collided with the host vehicle as he attempted to make a left turn to travel in a northerly direction. the front driver's side of the host vehicle collided with the front passenger side of the taxi. the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, inter alia, to recover damages for personal injuries. tucker moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him. in an order dated august 2, 2023, the supreme court denied tucker's motion. tucker appeals.

""while the driver with the right-of-way is entitled to assume that other drivers will obey the traffic laws requiring them to yield, the driver with the right-of-way also has an obligation to keep a proper lookout and see what can be seen through the reasonable use of his or her senses to avoid colliding with other vehicles"" ( woods v burgos , 220 ad3d at 689 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see richardson v cablevision sys. corp. , 173 ad3d at 1085). 

here, in support of his motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him, tucker submitted, among other things, transcripts of his and of giordano's deposition testimony. tucker failed to establish, prima facie, that he was free from fault in the happening of the collision or that the alleged negligence of giordano was the sole proximate cause of the collision ( see tsarenkov v rosenbaum , 231 ad3d 1184 , 1185; brunson v korkovilas , 208 ad3d at 842-843). specifically, tucker's own conflicting testimony raised triable issues of fact as to whether he failed to see what there was to be seen and exercised reasonable care to avoid the collision ( see brunson v korkovilas , 208 ad3d at 842-843; fergile v payne , 202 ad3d 928 , 930). since tucker failed to sustain his prima facie burden, we need not consider the sufficiency of the opposition papers ( see winegrad v new york univ. med. ctr. , 64 ny2d 851, 853 ).

ordered that the judgments are affirmed. the defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary in the first degree, in satisfaction of two indictments. as part of the plea agreement, the defendant waived his right to appeal. contrary to the defendant's contention, the record demonstrates that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to appeal ( see people v thomas , 34 ny3d 545 , 559-560; people v barnes , 210 ad3d 792 , 792-793). the defendant's valid waiver of his right to appeal precludes appellate review of his challenge to the county court's suppression determination ( see people v vidal , 233 ad3d 1055 , 1055; people v barnes , 210 ad3d at 793). by pleading guilty, the defendant forfeited review of any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that did not directly involve the plea-negotiation process and sentence ( see people v petgen , 55 ny2d 529 , 535 n 3; people v rodriquez , 194 ad3d 1078 ). to the extent that 

the defendant contends that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of his pleas or negotiate better pleas under the circumstances, such contention is without merit. to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the federal constitution, ""the defendant must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness"" and ""that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense"" ( strickland v washington , 466 us 668, 687-688 ; see people v ramroop , _____ ad3d _____, _____, 2025 ny slip op 01647, *1). in the context of a plea, a defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the defendant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, or that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different ( see people v ramroop , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01647 ; people v alexander , 208 ad3d 1247 , 1249). under the new york constitution, a defendant must show that he or she was not afforded ""meaningful representation"" ( people v baldi , 54 ny2d 137, 147 ), which also entails a two-pronged test. the first prong is identical to its federal counterpart ( see people v galan , 116 ad3d 787, 789 ). the second prong is ""based on the fairness of the process as a whole rather than the impact of counsel's errors on the outcome of the case"" ( people v parvez , 209 ad3d 885 , 886-887; see people v caban , 5 ny3d 143, 156 ). 

here, during the plea colloquy, the defendant stated that he was not a united states citizen, and defense counsel stated, ""i'm sorry, your honor. i didn't know that."" the county court immediately addressed this by telling the defendant, ""i need to make sure you understand that your plea of guilty may subject you to or result in your deportation, exclusion from the united states, or denied naturalization. and . . . [because] this is a violent felony offense you will be deported as a result of this plea. do you understand that?"" the defendant replied, ""yes."" when the court asked the defendant if he wished to consult with an immigration attorney, he said, ""no."" thereafter, the court, among other things, reiterated that the defendant would ""be deported as the result of this crime,"" and the defendant confirmed that he understood. further, at the end of the plea proceeding, defense counsel indicated that, by that point, defense counsel had discussed the ""certainty of deportation"" with the defendant. although defense counsel did not advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of his pleas prior to the plea proceeding, it is clear from the record that the county court repeatedly advised the defendant that he would be deported as a consequence of pleading guilty, and the defendant confirmed that he understood ( see people v facey , 180 ad3d 927 , 929). under the circumstances, the defendant was indisputably aware of the possible immigration consequences of pleading guilty before he entered his pleas. 

accordingly, the defendant cannot show prejudice resulting from defense counsel's failure to provide that advice prior to the plea proceeding ( see people v ramroop , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01647 ; people v facey , 180 ad3d at 929; see also people v singh , 231 ad3d 749 , 750). additionally, the defendant failed to demonstrate that an incentive to remain in the united states would have made it rational to reject a favorable plea offer ( see people v facey , 180 ad3d at 929).",high,['ineffective assistance of counsel']

here, the defendants' excuse of law office failure was vague and conclusory, and therefore, insufficient to establish a reasonable excuse for their failure to oppose the plaintiff's august 2022 motion ( see u.s. bank trust, n.a. v aulder , 219 ad3d 666 , 667; wright v brooklyn renaissance funding co., llc , 174 ad3d 676 , 677). since the defendants failed to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for not opposing the motion, it is unnecessary to determine whether they established a potentially meritorious opposition to the motion ( see rudsky v schechtman , 219 ad3d 1453 , 1455). furthermore, the supreme court properly denied that branch of the defendants' motion which was for leave to renew their prior motion, in effect, pursuant to cplr 5015(a) to vacate the subject portion of the order dated september 20, 2022. ""pursuant to cplr 2221, a motion for leave to renew 'shall be based upon new facts not offered on the prior motion that would change the prior determination' (cplr 2221[e][2]) and 'shall contain reasonable justification for the failure to present such facts on the prior motion' (cplr 2221[e][3])"" ( nunez v u.s. bank n.a. , 194 ad3d 944 , 946; see deutsche bank natl. trust co. v galloway , 214 ad3d 625 , 626).

ordered that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting the motion of the defendant reinaldo figueroa pursuant to cplr 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction, and substituting therefor a provision denying the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff. on march 4, 2020, the plaintiff, as parent and natural guardian of the infant n. j. g., commenced this action, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice, alleging that the defendants rendered negligent care and treatment during the pregnancy and delivery of the infant. the defendant reinaldo figueroa (hereinafter the defendant) served an answer and subsequently moved pursuant to cplr 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction due to defective service of process. in support of the motion, the defendant submitted an affidavit of service sworn to on march 24, 2020, in which the process server described the defendant as ""[a] connecticut corporation"" and attested that service was effectuated on the defendant by serving ""donald f. keene jd,"" as ""authorized agent"" thereof ( cf. id. ยง 311[a][1]). in opposition to the motion, the plaintiff submitted an amended affidavit of service in which the process server attested that service was effectuated upon the defendant on march 24, 2020, pursuant to cplr 308(2) by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to keene, a person of suitable age and discretion, at the defendant's actual place of business and by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant at his actual place of business. in addition, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit of service sworn to on january 25, 2021, in which the process server attested that service was effectuated upon the defendant on january 7, 2021, pursuant to cplr 308(2) by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to ""denise cotto"" at the defendant's actual place of business and by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant at his actual place of business. the plaintiff argued that the service on january 7, 2021, was timely pursuant to executive order (a. cuomo) no. 202.8 (9 nycrr 8.202.8). alternatively, the plaintiff cross-moved pursuant to cplr 306-b to extend the time to serve the summons and complaint upon the defendant. in an order dated december 6, 2021, the supreme court granted the defendant's motion and denied the plaintiff's cross-motion. the plaintiff appeals. contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the amended affidavit of service could not cure the deficiencies in the original affidavit of service, regardless of whether leave to amend the proof of service was sought ( see id. ยง 305[c]; john doe v mesivtha, inc. , 226 ad3d 971 , 973; hsbc bank usa, n.a. v rini , 218 ad3d 664 ; jampolskaya v ilona genis, md, p.c. , 205 ad3d 785 , 787). nevertheless, the supreme court erred in granting the defendant's motion pursuant to cplr 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction. service of a summons and complaint must be made within 120 days after commencement of the action ( see cplr 306-b). on march 20, 2020, on which date the time for the plaintiff to serve process had not lapsed, former governor andrew m. cuomo issued executive order 202.8, which tolled ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state, including but not limited to . . . the civil practice law and rules"" ( see blue lagoon, llc v reisman , 214 ad3d 938 , 942). the former governor issued a series of nine subsequent executive orders that continued the toll that was put in place by executive order 202.8 through november 3, 2020 ( see brash v richards , 195 ad3d 582 , 583-584). ""a toll . . . suspends the running of the applicable statute of limitations for a finite . . . time period,"" and ""the period of the toll is excluded from the calculation of the [relevant time period]"" ( chavez v occidental chem. corp. , 35 ny3d 492 , 505 n 8; see brash v richards , 195 ad3d at 582).

""'the two requirements for its application are: first, the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive in the present action, and second, the party to be precluded must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination'"" ( cullen v moschetta , 207 ad3d 699 , 700, quoting matter of abady , 22 ad3d 71, 81 ). ""'the party seeking to invoke collateral estoppel has the burden to show the identity of the issues, while the party trying to avoid application of the doctrine must establish the lack of a full and fair opportunity to litigate'"" ( villaver v paglinawan , 230 ad3d 533 , 535, quoting matter of dunn , 24 ny3d 699, 704 ). 

here, the majority of the plaintiff's allegations in this action were premised on her claim that the lindeman report was a forgery and that an authentic report existed that made findings in her favor. however, the supreme court, in the defamation action, determined that jamieson's statements regarding the substance of the lindeman report were accurate, including that lindeman found that jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible and that the plaintiff should be removed as voluntary library trustee if she declined to resign or receive managerial training. thus, the moving defendants established that the accuracy of the lindeman report, which the plaintiff challenges in this action, had been necessarily decided against her in the defamation action ( see gold v rothfeld , 220 ad3d 717 , 718; manko v gabay , 175 ad3d 484 , 486). in opposition, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that she lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue ( see mortgage elec. registration sys., inc. v mcvicar , 203 ad3d 919 , 920; demartino v lomonaco , 155 ad3d 686, 687 ). furthermore, to the extent the plaintiff raised allegations that were not precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the supreme court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. ""'on a motion to dismiss pursuant to cplr 3211(a)(7), the complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction, the facts alleged are presumed to be true, the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of every favorable inference, and the court is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory'"" ( clevenger v yuzek , 222 ad3d 931 , 934, quoting gorbatov v tsirelman , 155 ad3d 836, 837 ). pursuant to judiciary law ยง 487, an attorney who is ""guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party"" is liable to the injured party for treble damages ( see guliyev v banilov & assoc., p.c. , 221 ad3d 589 , 591). ""'a violation of judiciary law ยง 487 requires an intent to deceive'"" ( id. , quoting moormann v perini & hoerger , 65 ad3d 1106, 1108 ). ""'allegations regarding an act of deceit or intent to deceive must be stated with particularity'"" ( guliyev v banilov & assoc., p.c. , 221 ad3d at 591, quoting bill birds, inc. v stein law firm, p.c. , 164 ad3d 635 , 637, affd 25 ny3d 173 ). further, ""'an injury to the plaintiff resulting from the alleged deceitful conduct of the defendant attorney is an essential element of a cause of action based on a violation' of judiciary law ยง 487"" ( maroulis v sari m. friedman, p.c. , 153 ad3d 1250, 1252 [alteration omitted], quoting rozen v russ & russ, p.c. , 76 ad3d 965 , 968). ""thus, to state a cause of action alleging a violation of judiciary law ยง 487, the plaintiff must 'plead allegations from which damages attributable to the defendants' conduct might be reasonably inferred'"" ( maroulis v sari m. friedman, p.c. , 153 ad3d at 1252 , quoting mizuno v nunberg , 122 ad3d 594, 595 ). 

here, the plaintiff failed to allege sufficiently specific facts from which it could be reasonably inferred either that the defendants acted with the requisite degree of scienter or that the alleged acts of deceit were the proximate cause of any injury to the plaintiff ( see pinkesz mut. holdings, llc v pinkesz , 198 ad3d 693 , 697-698; sammy v haupel , 170 ad3d 1224 , 1225). furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, the supreme court providently exercised its discretion in granting that branch of the greenwald defendants' motion which was for certain injunctive relief to the extent of enjoining the plaintiff from commencing any new action pertaining to her removal as voluntary library trustee without prior written permission of the court ( see monaco v van meerendonk , 222 ad3d 744 ). while ""public policy mandates free access to the courts,"" ""a litigant can forfeit that right by[, as

ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs. in august 2018, the plaintiff was hired by the defendant as a phlebotomist, subject to a six-month probationary period. on january 15, 2019, the plaintiff was informed that her employment was terminated. in september 2019, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for employment discrimination. the amended complaint, filed in november 2019, alleged that the defendant discriminated against the plaintiff in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 (hereinafter title vii) (42 usc ยง 2000e et seq. ) and the new york state human rights law (hereinafter the nyshrl) (executive law ยง 296[1][a]) by terminating her employment based upon her pregnancy. the defendant moved for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint. in an order dated april 27, 2023, the supreme court granted the motion. the plaintiff appeals. the nyshrl makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual or to discharge such a person from employment on the basis of the individual's gender ( see id. ; golston-green v city of new york , 184 ad3d 24 , 34). ""discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is a form of gender discrimination"" ( golston-green v city of new york , 184 ad3d at 34; see lefort v kingsbrook jewish med. ctr. , 203 ad3d 708 , 709). the standards for establishing unlawful discrimination under the nyshrl previously were the same as those governing title vii cases ( see rainer n. mittl, ophthalmologist, p.c. v new york state div. of human rights , 100 ny2d 326, 330 ; ferrante v american lung assn. , 90 ny2d 623, 629 ). in 2019, however, the new york state legislature amended the nyshrl, in pertinent part, to require that it ""be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the remedial purposes thereof, regardless of whether federal civil rights laws, including those laws with provisions worded comparably to the provisions of this article, have been so construed"" (executive law ยง 300; l 2019, ch 160, ยง 6; see golston-green v city of new york , 184 ad3d at 35 n 1). that amendment was effective august 12, 2019 ( see l 2019, ch 160, ยง 16), and applies to causes of action, like the instant cause of action, that are filed on or after the effective date ( see id. ยง 16[d]; elco v aguiar , 226 ad3d 649 , 651; golston-green v city of new york , 184 ad3d at 35 n 1). as a result of the amendment, the nyshrl now aligns with the standards of the new york city human rights law (hereinafter the nychrl) ( see administrative code of city of ny ยง 8-130[a], [b]; syeed v bloomberg l.p. , 41 ny3d 446 , 451; cannizzaro v city of new york , 82 misc 3d 563 , 577 [sup ct, ny county]; stickler v ibm, inc. , 2024 wl 3952639 , *2 n 4, 2024 us dist lexis 154797 , *4 n 4 [sd ny, no. 22-cv-2449 (kmw)]; harlow v molina healthcare, inc. , 723 f supp 3d 116, 129 n 6[nd ny]). under the nychrl, unlawful discrimination must play ""no role"" in an employment decision ( singh v covenant aviation sec., llc , 131 ad3d 1158, 1161 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see lefort v kingsbrook jewish med. ctr. , 203 ad3d at 711-712). thus, a defendant's motion for summary judgment must be analyzed under both the familiar framework of mcdonnell douglas corp. v green ( 411 us 792 ) and under the newer mixed-motive framework, which imposes a lesser burden on a plaintiff opposing such a motion ( see reichman v city of new york , 179 ad3d 1115 , 1117; ellison v chartis claims, inc. , 178 ad3d 665 , 668; hamburg v new york univ. sch. of medicine , 155 ad3d 66, 72-73 ). ""a defendant must make 'a prima facie showing that there is no evidentiary route that could allow a jury to believe that discrimination played a role in their challenged actions'"" ( ellison v chartis claims, inc. , 178 ad3d at 668, quoting cenzon-decarlo v mount sinai hosp. , 101 ad3d 924 , 927; see lefort v kingsbrook jewish med. ctr. , 203 ad3d at 712). ""a plaintiff may defeat summary judgment by coming forward either with evidence that the defendant's stated reasons were a pretext for discrimination or with evidence that discrimination was one of the motivating factors for the defendant's conduct"" ( ellison v chartis claims, inc. , 178 ad3d at 668; see hamburg v new york univ. sch. of medicine , 155 ad3d at 73 ). applying these principles 

here, we conclude that the defendant established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the cause of action alleging a violation of the nyshrl by demonstrating that there was no evidentiary route that could allow a jury to find that discrimination played a role in the decision to terminate the plaintiff's employment ( cf. ellison v chartis claims, inc. , 178 ad3d at 668; kosarin-ritter v mrs. john l. strong, llc , 117 ad3d 603, 604 ). in opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the proffered explanations were a pretext for discrimination or whether discrimination was one of the motivating factors for the challenged action ( cf. ellison v chartis claims, inc. , 178 ad3d at 669; hamburg v new york univ. sch. of medicine , 155 ad3d at 76 ). the plaintiff offered nothing but speculation that the decision to terminate her employment was motivated, even in part, by unlawful discrimination, which is insufficient to defeat summary judgment ( see ellison v chartis claims, inc. , 178 ad3d at 669). the plaintiff's remaining contention is without merit. 

accordingly, the supreme court properly granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint.",low,[]

ordered that the judgment is affirmed, with costs. the subject property is located in a ""restricted business, residences excluded"" zone, in which a gas station is a permitted use while a convenience store in conjunction with a gas station is a permitted use with a special permit. in march 2018, the petitioner submitted an application for a special use permit to operate a convenience store in conjunction with a gas station on the subject property. after a public hearing, the planning board of the city of yonkers granted the application with certain conditions and referred the matter to the city council of the city of yonkers, ny (hereinafter the city council). after a second public hearing, the city council, emphasizing the community's objection, denied the application. thereafter, the petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to cplr article 78 to review the city council's determination. in a judgment dated march 30, 2022, the supreme court granted the petition, annulled the determination, and, in effect, directed the city council to issue the requested special use permit. the city of yonkers and the city council (hereinafter together the appellants) appeal. contrary to the appellants' contention, the city's planning board and planning bureau are not necessary parties to this proceeding, as they are not indispensable to the city council's determination of the petitioner's application ( see cplr 1001[a]; matter of transgas energy sys., llc v new york state bd. on elec. generation siting & envt. , 65 ad3d 1247, 1249-1250 ). ""unlike a variance, a special [use] permit does not entail a use of the property forbidden by the zoning ordinance but, instead, constitutes a recognition of a use which the ordinance permits under stated conditions"" ( matter of quickchek corp. v town of islip , 166 ad3d 982 , 983). ""the significance of this distinction is that the 'inclusion of the permitted use in the ordinance is tantamount to a legislative finding that the permitted use is in harmony with the general zoning plan and will not adversely affect the neighborhood'"" ( matter of retail prop. trust v board of zoning appeals of town of hempstead , 98 ny2d 190, 195 , quoting matter of north shore steak house v board of appeals of inc. vil. of thomaston , 30 ny2d 238, 243 ). ""thus, the burden of proof on an applicant seeking a special permit is lighter than that required for a hardship variance"" ( matter of quickchek corp. v town of islip , 166 ad3d at 983). ""the approval or denial of an application for a special use permit is an administrative rather than a legislative function and the action of a legislative body in denying such a permit is subject to judicial review under article 78 of the cplr"" ( mobil oil corp. v city of syracuse , 52 ad2d 731, 732 ). ""once an applicant shows 'that the contemplated use is in conformance with the conditions imposed, a special [use] permit or exception must be granted unless there are reasonable grounds for denying it that are supported by substantial evidence'"" ( matter of mamaroneck coastal envt. coalition, inc. v board of appeals of the vil. of mamaroneck , 152 ad3d 771, 772 , quoting matter of leon petroleum v board of trustees of inc. vil. of mineola , 309 ad2d 804, 805 ). ""in reviewing a [city council]'s determination on special [use] permit applications, we are 'limited to determining whether the action taken by the [council] was illegal, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion,' and we 'consider substantial evidence only to determine whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support the rationality of the [council]'s determination'"" ( matter of quickchek corp. v town of islip , 166 ad3d at 983, quoting matter of beekman delamater props., llc v village of rhinebeck zoning bd. of appeals , 150 ad3d 1099, 1103 ). ""'a denial of a special [use] permit must be supported by evidence in the record and may not be based solely upon community objection'"" ( id. at 983-984, quoting matter of white castle sys., inc. v board of zoning appeals of town of hempstead , 93 ad3d 731, 732 ; see matter of chestnut petroleum dist., inc. v town of mount pleasant planning board , 222 ad3d 748 ). 

here, the city council's determination to deny the petitioner's application lacked a rational basis. there was no evidence adduced demonstrating that the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood or community would be detrimentally affected if the application was granted ( see matter of 666 ocrtt, llc v board of zoning appeals of the town of hempstead , 200 ad3d 682 , 684; matter of quickchek corp. v town of islip , 166 ad3d at 984; matter of marina's edge owner's corp. v city of new rochelle zoning bd. of appeals , 129 ad3d 841, 843 ).

36,"Deborah Schiffman, etc., appellant, v Affordable Shoes, Ltd., et al., respondents- respondents, et al., respondent.","judgment, supreme court, new york county (gregory carro, j.), rendered january 12, 2022, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of one count of persistent sexual abuse and sentencing him to a determinate term of three years followed by seven years of postrelease supervision, unanimously modified, on the law, to the extent of vacating the sentence and remanding for resentencing, and otherwise affirmed. on december 3, 2021, defendant appeared with counsel and entered a plea of guilty to the felony of persistent sexual abuse in exchange for a sentence of three years of incarceration, to be followed by seven years of postrelease supervision. defendant admitted that on november 24, 2020, he grabbed the complaining witness and squeezed her buttocks. defendant confirmed that he was previously convicted of forcible touching in 2015, and again for a separate forcible touching offense in 2016. following entry of the guilty plea, defendant declined to dispute the predicate felony statement, which alleged that defendant was previously convicted of persistent sexual abuse in 2018. the department of probation submitted a presentence report on january 11, 2022, the day prior to sentencing. defendant alleges that he was never interviewed by the department and correctly notes that several critical sections of the report are incomplete. for example, the summary of defendant's statement and evaluative analysis sections state that defendant's case was reassigned, and the new investigation officer needs additional time to prepare the report. further, the evaluative analysis section requests an adjournment and a new court order to the department of probation so they could obtain the necessary information. the report contains no information about defendant's mental or physical health, the circumstances of his arrest, or the promised sentence. finally, the report incorrectly lists 2013 as the last time he used controlled substances or alcohol. on january 12, 2022, defendant appeared before the court for sentencing without the presence of his assigned counsel. upon the court's request, another attorney from the same office appeared virtually on the matter. there is no indication that the substitute attorney had any knowledge of defendant's case or had reviewed the presentence report. when the court informed the substitute attorney of the negotiated sentence, the attorney stated, ""[a]s long as my client agrees that's the promise, i have nothing further."" prior to imposing sentence, defendant inquired whether the postrelease portion of his sentence would terminate his postrelease sentence from a prior conviction. the court responded equivocally, stating ""i don't believe that terminates that""; and ""i believe so"" when defendant replied, ""[s]o, that's going to be combined with this seven."" in response to this exchange, substitute counsel made no inquiry or statements. the court then imposed the promised sentence with no discussion of the presentence report or a definitive answer to defendant's question concerning the duration of his postrelease supervision. defendant served his period of incarceration and has since been released. defendant argues that his sentence was excessive because the presentence report failed to include, and the court failed to consider, defendant's extensive history of personal trauma, substance abuse, and mental health issues, and requests the court to reduce his postrelease supervision to the minimum term of five years. where a person is convicted of a felony, the court must order a presentence investigation of the defendant and it may not pronounce sentence until it has received a written report of that investigation (cpl 390.20[1]; see people v selikoff, 35 ny2d 227, 238 [1974], cert denied 419 us 1122 [1975][""the statute mandates, and it is the public policy of this state to require, a presentence report before sentence be imposed""]). the presentence report must be current and contain updated information pertinent to the imposition of a proper sentence ( see people v laster, 140 ad2d 233, 233 [1st dept 1988], citing people v saez, 121 ad2d 947 [1st dept 1986], affd 69 ny2d 802 [1987][three-and-a-half-year-old presentence report that contained no information regarding the defendant's background, activities in prison, or history following release from prison was inadequate]). we hold that the presentence report in this case was inadequate, as it omitted crucial information regarding defendant's history of trauma, mental health and substance abuse issues and failed to include a victim impact statement, among other things (cpl 390.30). we particularly note that defendant had not been interviewed prior to the report's issuance and that probation requested an adjournment of sentencing so that the newly assigned case officer could conduct the investigation. defendant, who was not represented by his assigned counsel at sentencing, did not waive his entitlement to a current, updated report by failing to affirmatively object to the presentence report's sufficiency ( see people v andujar, 110 ad2d 606, 607-608 [1st dept 1985] [failure to object to absence of presentence report at sentencing does not constitute waiver]). because the court pronounced sentence prior to receiving a current and complete presentence report, we vacate the sentence and remand the matter for resentencing in compliance with cpl 390.20(1) ( see people v saez, 121 ad2d at 948 ). we have considered the remaining arguments and find them unavailing.",low,[]

here, the supreme court providently exercised its discretion in denying fenimore's cross-motion to reduce the interest accrued. fenimore failed to establish any bad faith or undue delay on the part of the plaintiff that would warrant a reduction in the postjudgment interest ( see wells fargo bank, n.a. v abakporo , 221 ad3d at 940).",low,[]

""to establish sufficient cause, the plaintiff must 'proffer a reasonable excuse for the delay in timely moving for a default judgment and . . . demonstrate that the cause of action is potentially meritorious'"" ( id. , quoting hsbc bank usa, n.a. v grella , 145 ad3d 669, 671 ). where an action is subject to a mandatory settlement conference ( see cplr 3408), motions shall be held in abeyance while conferences are held and the one-year deadline imposed by cplr 3215(c) is tolled ( see 22 nycrr 202.12-a[c][7]; deutsche bank natl. trust co. v o'connor , 223 ad3d at 874). 

here, the defendant was personally served with process on february 22, 2012, and thus, had 20 days, or until march 13, 2012, to answer or otherwise appear in the action ( see cplr 320[a]; 3012[a]). the defendant failed to do so, and therefore, was in default as of march 14, 2012. thus, the plaintiff had one year from march 14, 2012, to take proceedings for the entry of a default judgment ( see id. ยง 3215[c]). the plaintiff did not take such proceedings until approximately 14 months later, when it moved, inter alia, for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant and an order of reference in may 2013. contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the one-year deadline pursuant to cplr 3215(c) was not tolled for the period of approximately two months after the rji was filed on may 2, 2012, and before the action was released from the foreclosure settlement part on july 10, 2012. pursuant to cplr 3408(a), mandatory settlement conferences must be held ""in any residential foreclosure action involving a home loan as such term is defined in [rpapl 1304], in which the defendant is a resident of the property subject to foreclosure "" (cplr 3408[a][1] [emphasis added]; see 22 nycrr ยง 202.12-a[a]; bank of n.y. mellon v lee , 201 ad3d 852 , 853; richlew real estate venture v grant , 131 ad3d 1223, 1224 ). 

here, the record reflects that the defendant was not a resident of the subject property at the time this action was commenced, and therefore, that the action was not subject to mandatory settlement conferences ( see hsbc bank usa, n.a. v seidner , 159 ad3d 1035 , 1036). thus, the plaintiff's time to move for leave to enter a default judgment was not tolled while the matter was in the foreclosure settlement conference part ( see id. ). further, ""where . . . a settlement conference is a necessary prerequisite to obtaining a default judgment,"" the filing of an rji seeking a mandatory foreclosure settlement conference constitutes the taking of proceedings for the entry of judgment pursuant to cplr 3215(c) ( citimortgage, inc. v zaibak , 188 ad3d 982 , 983; see u.s. bank n.a. v jerriho-cadogan , 224 ad3d 788 , 790). 

here, however, since the action was not subject to mandatory foreclosure settlement conferences ( see hsbc bank usa, n.a. v seidner , 159 ad3d 1035 , 1036), a settlement conference was not ""a necessary prerequisite to obtaining a default judgment"" ( citimortgage, inc. v zaibak , 188 ad3d at 983), and therefore, the plaintiff's filing of the rji did not constitute the taking of proceedings for the entry of judgment within the meaning of cplr 3215(c). nevertheless, under the particular circumstances of this case, the plaintiff demonstrated a reasonable excuse for failing to timely move for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant based upon its reasonable belief that the action was subject to mandatory foreclosure settlement conferences ( see u.s. bank n.a. v 63 holiday drive realty corp. , 230 ad3d 713 , 714). moreover, the plaintiff demonstrated a potentially meritorious cause of action. 

accordingly, the supreme court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale and denied the defendant's cross-motion pursuant to cplr 3215(c) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him as abandoned. the defendant's remaining contentions are without merit.",high,['default judgment']

the defendant appeals. contrary to the defendant's contention, the supreme court properly assessed 15 points under risk factor 11, as the people established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offense and had a history of substance abuse ( see people v velasco-morales , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01655 ; people v coleman , 225 ad3d 792 ). the defendant's contention that the supreme court improperly assessed 10 points under risk factor 15 is unpreserved for appellate review, as he failed to raise this contention at the sora hearing ( see cpl 470.05[2]; people v melendez , 210 ad3d 1121 , 1122; people v bethel , 165 ad3d 712 , 713). in any event, this contention is without merit. a defendant seeking a downward departure from the presumptive risk level has the initial burden of ""(1) identifying, as a matter of law, an appropriate mitigating factor, namely, a factor which tends to establish a lower likelihood of reoffense or danger to the community and is of a kind, or to a degree, that is otherwise not adequately taken into account by the guidelines; and (2) establishing the facts in support of its existence by a preponderance of the evidence"" ( people v wyatt , 89 ad3d 112, 128 ; see sex offender registration act: risk assessment guidelines and commentary at 4 [2006] [hereinafter guidelines]; people v gillotti , 23 ny3d 841, 861 ).

here, the plaintiff contends that the october 2020 letter served as a valid notice of claim. however, the october 2020 letter failed to comply with the specificity requirements of general municipal law ยง 50-e(2), as it, inter alia, failed to describe the location of the plaintiff's accident with sufficient specificity, and thus, the october 2020 letter was insufficient to serve as a valid notice of claim ( see behrens v town of huntington , 230 ad3d at 732). furthermore, even taking into account executive order (a. cuomo) no. 202.8 (9 nycrr 8.202.8), which tolled certain statutes of limitation in response to the covid-19 pandemic through november 4, 2020, the plaintiff only had 90 days after the toll was lifted, or until february 2, 2021, to serve a notice of claim, and she failed to do so. therefore, the plaintiff failed to comply with the condition precedent of general municipal law ยง 50-e(1), as she failed to timely serve a notice of claim.

here, the plaintiff's submissions in support of his motion, including a transcript of his deposition testimony, failed to eliminate triable issues of fact as to whether adequate safety devices were provided to him at the work site and, if not, whether the absence of adequate safety devices was a proximate cause of the accident ( see lewis v lester's of n.y., inc. , 205 ad3d 796 , 798; guaman v 178 ct. st., llc , 200 ad3d at 657). since the plaintiff failed to establish his prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of labor law ยง 240(1), the supreme court properly denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on that cause of action insofar as asserted against the defendant, without regard to the sufficiency of the opposition papers ( see winegrad v new york univ. med. ctr. , 64 ny2d 851, 853 ).

here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff ( see jean-joseph v port auth. of n.y. & n.j. , 211 ad3d 717 , 718), the defendant failed to eliminate triable issues of fact as to whether adequate safety devices were readily available to the plaintiff ( see lochan v h & h sons home improvement, inc. , 216 ad3d at 633; welsch v maimonides med. ctr. , 80 ad3d at 756 ). moreover, the defendant failed to demonstrate, prima facie, that the plaintiff was specifically instructed to use ropes while working on the roof and disregarded those instructions ( see gurung v arnav retirement trust , 79 ad3d 969, 970 ; santo v scro , 43 ad3d 897, 898-899 ). thus, the defendant failed to establish, prima facie, that the plaintiff was the sole proximate cause of the accident or was a recalcitrant worker.

""when a foster care agency brings a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the ground of permanent neglect, it must, as a threshold matter, prove by clear and convincing evidence that it has fulfilled its statutory duty to exercise diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parent-child relationship"" ( matter of shimon g.

[sonia c.] , 235 ad3d 865 , 856 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see matter of shimon g.

here, the agency met its burden of establishing that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children. the agency demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that it made diligent efforts to strengthen each parent's relationship with the children by formulating a service plan that served each parent's needs, providing referrals to programs, explaining the importance of compliance with the service plan, and facilitating parental access between the parents and the children. moreover, the record shows that the parents failed to plan for the children's futures, despite the agency's diligent efforts, as they only partially complied with their service plans ( see matter of damaris e.a. [johanna a.m.] , 217 ad3d 860 , 861; matter of shimon g. [batsheva g.] , 206 ad3d at 734). 

accordingly, the family court properly found that the parents permanently neglected the children. the evidence adduced at the dispositional hearing established that termination of the parental rights of the mother and the father was in the best interests of the children ( see matter of abbygail h.m.g.

50,"Sonja Brown-Clarke, Plaintiff-Respondent, v The City of New York, Defendant, Riverbay Corporation, Defendant-Appellant.","appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the county court, orange county (craig s. brown, j.), rendered may 16, 2023, convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. the appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. 

ordered that the judgment is affirmed. the defendant was arrested after a stop and frisk resulting in the recovery of a firearm. after a hearing, the county court denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress the physical evidence recovered, including the firearm, and the defendant's statements made to law enforcement officials. after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. 

the defendant appeals. pursuant to people v de bour ( 40 ny2d 210 ), there is ""a graduated four-level test for evaluating the propriety of police encounters when a police officer is acting in a law enforcement capacity"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d 869 , 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see people v alleyne , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01941 ). ""the first level permits a police officer to request information from an individual, and merely requires that the request be supported by an objective, credible reason, not necessarily indicative of criminality"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""the second level, known as the common-law right of inquiry, requires a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, and permits a somewhat greater intrusion"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, the subject may be asked to produce identification, may be asked whether he [or she] has weapons, and may be asked to remove his [or her] hands from his [or her] pockets"" ( matter of shakir j. , 119 ad3d 792, 794-795 [citation omitted]; see people v alleyne , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01941 ; people v muhammed , 196 ad3d 1151 , 1152-1153). ""the third level permits a police officer to forcibly stop and detain an individual"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""such a detention, however, is not permitted unless there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""a corollary of the statutory right to temporarily detain for questioning is the authority to frisk if the officer reasonably suspects that he [or she] is in danger of physical injury by virtue of the detainee being armed"" ( people v de bour , 40 ny2d at 223 ). ""the fourth level authorizes an arrest based on probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime"" ( people v benbow , 193 ad3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

here, in light of the evidence demonstrating that the defendant matched the general description of the perpetrator, who had brandished a firearm, that was broadcast over the police radio, along with the defendant's temporal and spatial proximity to the scene of that incident, and the officers' observations that the defendant put his hands in his waistband, the police had reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the defendant ( see people v de bour , 40 ny2d at 223 ; people v alleyne , _____ ad3d _____, 2025 ny slip op 01941 ; people v richardson , 219 ad3d 637 , 638; people v maschoun , 186 ad3d 1402 , 1403; people v currie , 131 ad3d 1265 ; people v abdul-mateen , 126 ad3d 986, 988 ). to the extent that 

the defendant contends that introducing his statements made to law enforcement officials violated his miranda rights ( see miranda v arizona , 384 us 436 ), the evidence at the hearing established that the statements were made spontaneously and were not the product of police interrogation or its functional equivalent ( see people v martinez , 186 ad3d 1530 , 1531; people v barnes , 171 ad3d 1082 , 1082). 

accordingly, the county court properly denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. the defendant's contention that penal law ยง 265.03 is unconstitutional in light of the decision in new york state rifle & pistol assn., inc. v bruen ( 597 us 1 ) is unpreserved for appellate review, as the defendant failed to raise a constitutional challenge before the county court ( see people v robb , 233 ad3d 805 ; people v bynum , 225 ad3d 781 , 781; people v chase , 223 ad3d 913 , 913). in any event, the bruen decision ""had no impact on the constitutionality of new york state's criminal possession of a weapon statutes"" ( people v manners , 217 ad3d 683 , 686; see people v sargeant , 230 ad3d 1341 , 1355; people v chase , 223 ad3d at 913). the defendant's contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel is without merit. under both the state and federal standards for ineffective assistance of counsel, ""[t]here can be no denial of effective assistance . . . arising from counsel's failure to make a motion or argument that has little or no chance of success"" ( people v caban , 5 ny3d 143, 152 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see people v parvez , 209 ad3d 885 , 887; people v clark , 171 ad3d 942 , 944; see also people v kamara , 234 ad3d 496 , 497). the defendant's remaining contention is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, without merit.",high,['ineffective assistance of counsel']
