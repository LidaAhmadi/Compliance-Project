0,"The People of the State of New York, respondent, v Nicholas Palm, appellant.","Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County (Craig S. Brown, J.), rendered May 16, 2023, convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. The defendant was arrested after a stop and frisk resulting in the recovery of a firearm. After a hearing, the County Court denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress the physical evidence recovered, including the firearm, and the defendant's statements made to law enforcement officials. After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. 

The defendant appeals. Pursuant to People v De Bour ( 40 NY2d 210 ), there is ""a graduated four-level test for evaluating the propriety of police encounters when a police officer is acting in a law enforcement capacity"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d 869 , 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ). ""The first level permits a police officer to request information from an individual, and merely requires that the request be supported by an objective, credible reason, not necessarily indicative of criminality"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""The second level, known as the common-law right of inquiry, requires a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, and permits a somewhat greater intrusion"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""Based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, the subject may be asked to produce identification, may be asked whether he [or she] has weapons, and may be asked to remove his [or her] hands from his [or her] pockets"" ( Matter of Shakir J. , 119 AD3d 792, 794-795 [citation omitted]; see People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ; People v Muhammed , 196 AD3d 1151 , 1152-1153). ""The third level permits a police officer to forcibly stop and detain an individual"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""Such a detention, however, is not permitted unless there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""A corollary of the statutory right to temporarily detain for questioning is the authority to frisk if the officer reasonably suspects that he [or she] is in danger of physical injury by virtue of the detainee being armed"" ( People v De Bour , 40 NY2d at 223 ). ""The fourth level authorizes an arrest based on probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

Here, in light of the evidence demonstrating that the defendant matched the general description of the perpetrator, who had brandished a firearm, that was broadcast over the police radio, along with the defendant's temporal and spatial proximity to the scene of that incident, and the officers' observations that the defendant put his hands in his waistband, the police had reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the defendant ( see People v De Bour , 40 NY2d at 223 ; People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ; People v Richardson , 219 AD3d 637 , 638; People v Maschoun , 186 AD3d 1402 , 1403; People v Currie , 131 AD3d 1265 ; People v Abdul-Mateen , 126 AD3d 986, 988 ). To the extent that 

the defendant contends that introducing his statements made to law enforcement officials violated his Miranda rights ( see Miranda v Arizona , 384 US 436 ), the evidence at the hearing established that the statements were made spontaneously and were not the product of police interrogation or its functional equivalent ( see People v Martinez , 186 AD3d 1530 , 1531; People v Barnes , 171 AD3d 1082 , 1082). 

Accordingly, the County Court properly denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. The defendant's contention that Penal Law ยง 265.03 is unconstitutional in light of the decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v Bruen ( 597 US 1 ) is unpreserved for appellate review, as the defendant failed to raise a constitutional challenge before the County Court ( see People v Robb , 233 AD3d 805 ; People v Bynum , 225 AD3d 781 , 781; People v Chase , 223 AD3d 913 , 913). In any event, the Bruen decision ""had no impact on the constitutionality of New York State's criminal possession of a weapon statutes"" ( People v Manners , 217 AD3d 683 , 686; see People v Sargeant , 230 AD3d 1341 , 1355; People v Chase , 223 AD3d at 913). The defendant's contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel is without merit. Under both the state and federal standards for ineffective assistance of counsel, ""[t]here can be no denial of effective assistance . . . arising from counsel's failure to make a motion or argument that has little or no chance of success"" ( People v Caban , 5 NY3d 143, 152 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Parvez , 209 AD3d 885 , 887; People v Clark , 171 AD3d 942 , 944; see also People v Kamara , 234 AD3d 496 , 497). The defendant's remaining contention is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, without merit."
1,"Maria Airene Pantanilla, respondent, v Guillerma Yuson, appellant.","In an action, in effect, to recover damages for money had and received and unjust enrichment, the defendant appeals from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Dawn Jimenez, J.), dated March 17, 2023. The judgment, upon an order of the same court entered March 15, 2023, granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to enter a default judgment, is in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed, with costs. On December 2, 2021, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant, alleging that the plaintiff and the defendant reached an agreement pursuant to which the plaintiff would purchase the defendant's grocery store and restaurant for $440,940. In consideration of that agreement, the plaintiff made installment payments totaling $40,000 to the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant rescinded the agreement and did not return the sum of $40,000. The plaintiff asserted, in effect, causes of action to recover damages for money had and received and unjust enrichment. On December 7, 2021, the plaintiff served the defendant with the summons and complaint. On December 22, 2021, the defendant's counsel filed a notice of appearance. Thereafter, the defendant failed to answer the complaint. In December 2022, the plaintiff moved for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant. By order entered March 15, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion. On March 17, 2023, a judgment, upon the order, was entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. 

The defendant appeals. ""'On a motion for leave to enter a default judgment against a defendant based on the failure to answer or appear, a plaintiff must submit proof of service of the summons and complaint, proof of the facts constituting the cause of action, and proof of the defendant's default'"" ( Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Gross , 201 AD3d 942 , 944, quoting L & Z Masonry Corp. v Mose , 167 AD3d 728 , 729; see CPLR 3215[f]). ""Since defaulters are deemed to have admitted all factual allegations contained in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that flow from them, when submitting proof of facts constituting a claim, a plaintiff need only set forth enough facts to enable the Supreme Court to determine that the plaintiff alleged a viable cause of action"" ( Rosenzweig v Gubner , 194 AD3d 1086 , 1088 [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Global Liberty Ins. Co. v Haar Orthopaedics & Sports Med., P.C. , 170 AD3d 1125 , 1126). ""To defeat a facially sufficient CPLR 3215 motion, a defendant must show either that there was no default, or that it had a reasonable excuse for its delay and a potentially meritorious defense"" ( National Loan Invs., L.P. v Bruno , 191 AD3d 999 , 1001; see U.S. Bank N.A. v Crockett , 201 AD3d 767 , 768). 

Here, in support of her motion for leave to enter a default judgment, the plaintiff made the required showing by submitting proof of service of the summons and complaint, proof of the facts constituting the causes of action, and proof of the defendant's default. In opposition, the defendant contended that she was not in default because her counsel served a notice of appearance. However, service of a notice of appearance does not ""'absolve a defendant from complying with the time restrictions imposed by CPLR 320(a) which govern the service of an answer or the making of a motion pursuant to CPLR 3211'"" ( 21st Mtge. Corp. v Raghu , 197 AD3d 1212 , 1216, quoting Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v Hall , 185 AD3d 1006 , 1009-1010; see CPLR 320(a); 3211). Similarly, the defendant's contention that her failure to timely answer should be excused because the plaintiff did not respond to the demand for service of the summons and complaint in the notice of appearance is without merit, since the plaintiff had already properly served a summons and complaint ( see CPLR 320[a], [b]; 3211[a][8]; Travelon, Inc. v Maekitan , 215 AD3d 710 , 713-714; 21st Mtge. Corp. v Raghu , 197 AD3d at 1216). The defendant's contention that her default should be excused due to law office failure is improperly raised for the first time on appeal ( see Matter of Regina Metro. Co., LLC v New York State Div. of Hous. & Community Renewal , 35 NY3d 332 , 362-363; Crudele v Price , 218 AD3d 534 , 536). In light of the defendant's failure to establish a reasonable excuse for her default, it is unnecessary to determine whether she demonstrated a potentially meritorious defense ( see U.S. Bank N.A. v Carucci , 217 AD3d 894 , 895; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Eliacin , 206 AD3d 950 , 952). The defendant's remaining contention is without merit. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to enter a default judgment."
2,"Franklin Carroll, LLC, appellant, v Carroll Development Plaza, LLC, respondent.","In an action, inter alia, for injunctive relief and to recover damages for trespass, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Carolyn E. Wade, J.), dated February 27, 2024. The order denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and, in effect, granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, among other things, to access the plaintiff's real property, subject to certain conditions. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. The plaintiff and the defendant own adjacent real properties located in Brooklyn. In 2019, in furtherance of the defendant's plan to construct a building on its property, the parties entered into a license agreement. The plaintiff agreed to permit the defendant to access the plaintiff's property and to install ""TEMPORARY PROTECTIONS"" on the plaintiff's property, including, monitoring equipment, a construction fence on the lot line, and a construction shed and scaffold in the plaintiff's rear yard. In consideration, the defendant agreed, inter alia, to pay to the plaintiff a monthly licensing fee, commencing upon the installation of the temporary protections. The defendant deposited with the plaintiff's attorney licensing fees for the first six months, to be held in escrow. However, the defendant's project was delayed and it is undisputed that the term of the license agreement expired on October 22, 2021, without the defendant ever having entered upon the plaintiff's property. The funds held in escrow were not returned to the defendant. In 2023, the parties attempted to negotiate a new license agreement, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, in September 2023, the defendant entered upon the plaintiff's property and installed temporary protections. The defendant then began construction of its building. On or about January 24, 2024, the plaintiff commenced this action, among other things, for an injunction directing the defendant to remove the temporary protections and to refrain from entering upon the plaintiff's property and to recover damages for trespass. The following day, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. Invoking RPAPL 881, the defendant cross-moved for a license, inter alia, to access the plaintiff's property. The Supreme Court granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, upon certain specified conditions, including the payment of monthly licensing fees as set forth in the 2019 license agreement, with a credit for the fees already paid, and requirements that the defendant name the plaintiff as an additional insured on its commercial general liability insurance policy and repair any physical damage to the plaintiff's property caused by the defendant's access. The court also denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff appeals. RPAPL 881 allows an owner of real property planning to make improvements thereon to seek a license to enter the premises of an adjoining owner when such entry is necessary to make the improvements and the adjoining owner has refused such access ( see id. ; Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d 833 , 834). In determining whether to grant a license pursuant to RPAPL 881, the court may consider the following factors: ""the nature and extent of the requested access, the duration of the access, the protections to the adjoining property that are needed, the lack of an alternative means to perform the work, the public interest in the completion of the project, and the measures in place to ensure the financial compensation of the adjoining owner for any damage or inconvenience resulting from the intrusion"" ( Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835; see Matter of Queens Coll. Special Projects Fund, Inc. v Newman , 154 AD3d 943, 944 ). In general, ""[c]ourts are required to balance the interests of the parties and should issue a license when necessary, under reasonable conditions, and where the inconvenience to the adjacent property owner is relatively slight compared to the hardship of his [or her] neighbor if the license is refused"" ( Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835 [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

Here, the Supreme Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in issuing a license to the defendant with specified conditions. The defendant's evidence demonstrated that the temporary protections would be in place for no more than 12 months and were necessary for the defendant to construct its building while protecting the plaintiff's property in accordance with the requirements of the New York City Building Code ( see Matter of Queens Coll. Special Projects Fund, Inc. v Newman , 154 AD3d at 944 ). Further, the plaintiff would be protected financially by the defendant's payment of substantial monthly licensing fees, being named as an additional insured on the defendant's insurance policy, and the defendant's payment for any physical damage to the plaintiff's property ( see id. ; Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835). In opposition to the defendant's showing, the plaintiff did not submit any evidence, such as an opposing expert affidavit, to show that, or to raise any triable issues of fact as to whether, the temporary protections were unnecessary or unreasonable or that the balance of the parties' interests required denial of the license. Further, as no triable issues of fact were raised, the plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing on the defendant's request for a license ( see RPAPL 881; CPLR 409). Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the Supreme Court's granting of a license did not serve to excuse, after the fact, the defendant's trespass on the plaintiff's property. The license was not granted nunc pro tunc to the defendant's entry onto the plaintiff's property in September 2023. Nor was such relief requested by the defendant. Thus, the defendant's use of the plaintiff's property was licensed only as of the issuance of the court's order. Contrary to the plaintiff's further contention, in issuing the license, the Supreme Court had the authority to impose ""such terms as justice requires,"" including the terms to which the parties had previously agreed in the 2019 license agreement (RPAPL 881). The conditions imposed by the court were not an improvident exercise of its discretion. The Supreme Court also did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. ""Although the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial, the remedy is considered a drastic one, which should be used sparingly"" ( Soundview Cinemas, Inc. v AC I Soundview, LLC , 149 AD3d 1121, 1123 ). ""To obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant must establish (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction, and (3) a balancing of the equities in the movant's favor"" ( Samaha v Brooklyn Bridge Park Corp. , 230 AD3d 608 , 610 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see CPLR 6301). 

Here, while the plaintiff showed a likelihood of success on its cause of action to recover damages for the past trespass ( see Umlas v Britton , 222 AD3d 1031 , 1032; Shrage v Con Edison Co. , 216 AD3d 1023 , 1025-1026), it is not likely to succeed on its cause of action for an injunction in light of the order granting the defendant's cross-motion for a license ( see Spatafore v U.S. Bank Trust N.A. , 231 AD3d 985 , 986). Furthermore, even absent the granting of the license, at the point when the plaintiff made its motion, the balance of the equities favored the defendant. Among other things, the defendant demonstrated that removal of the temporary protections at that time would have endangered the plaintiff's property, the occupants of the property, and the general public. Further, the defendant accessed the plaintiff's property under conditions to which the plaintiff had previously agreed and for which it had been partially paid. Under the circumstances, even without considering the license granted to the defendant in the order, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to a preliminary injunction ( see Soundview Cinemas, Inc. v AC I Soundview, LLC , 149 AD3d at 1124 ). The parties' remaining contentions are either without merit or not properly before this Court as they are based on matter dehors the record. 

Accordingly, we affirm the order appealed from."
3,"Pamela De Phillips, etc., appellant, v Nicole Pascone Perez, respondent.","In related proceedings pursuant to Family Court Act article 8, the petitioner appeals from an order of the Family Court, Kings County (Sharon N. Clarke, J.), dated October 17, 2023. The order, without a hearing, dismissed the family offense petition and the violation petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 

ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, without costs or disbursements, the family offense petition and the violation petition are reinstated, and the matter is remitted to the Family Court, Kings County, for a hearing to determine whether the Family Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Family Court Act ยง 812(1)(e) and further proceedings thereafter, if warranted. The petitioner and her former husband have a child in common. In May 2021, the petitioner filed a family offense petition on behalf of the child, against the respondent, the paramour of the former husband. On October 7, 2022, a temporary order of protection was issued, inter alia, in favor of the child, and the petitioner subsequently filed another petition on behalf of the child, alleging that the respondent violated the temporary order of protection. The Family Court, without conducting a hearing, dismissed the family offense petition and the violation petition on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The petitioner appeals. The ""Family Court is a court of limited jurisdiction that cannot exercise powers beyond those granted to it by statute"" ( Matter of Eno v Illovsky , 214 AD3d 865 , 866 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Silverman v Leibowitz , 208 AD3d 1332 , 1333). ""Pursuant to Family Court Act ยง 812(1), the Family Court's jurisdiction in family offense proceedings is limited to certain prescribed acts that occur between spouses or former spouses, or between parent and child or between members of the same family or household"" ( Matter of Watson v Brown , 225 AD3d 613 , 614 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Raigosa v Zafirakopoulos , 167 AD3d 748 , 748). ""'[M]embers of the same family or household' include, among others, 'persons who are not related by consanguinity or affinity and who are or have been in an intimate relationship regardless of whether such persons have lived together at any time'"" ( Matter of Woldeselassie v Colon , 227 AD3d 725 , 726, quoting Family Ct Act ยง 812[1][e]; see Matter of Watson v Brown , 225 AD3d at 614). ""Beyond expressly excluding from the definition of 'intimate relationship' a 'casual acquaintance' and 'ordinary fraternization between two individuals in business or social contexts'"" ( Matter of Eno v Illovsky , 214 AD3d at 867, quoting Family Ct Act ยง 812[1][e]), ""the [L]egislature left it to the courts to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what qualifies as an 'intimate relationship' within the meaning of Family Court Act ยง 812(1)(e)"" ( Matter of Jose M. v Angel V. , 99 AD3d 243 , 247; see Matter of Eno v Illovsky , 214 AD3d at 867; Matter of Rizzo v Pravato , 170 AD3d 860 , 861). The factors that a court may consider while making such a determination are ""the nature or type of relationship, regardless of whether the relationship is sexual in nature; the frequency of interaction between the persons; and the duration of the relationship"" (Family Ct Act ยง 812[1][e]; see Matter of Silverman v Leibowitz , 208 AD3d at 1333). ""[T]he determination as to whether persons are or have been in an 'intimate relationship' within the meaning of Family Court Act ยง 812(1)(e) is a fact-specific determination which may require a hearing"" ( Matter of Jose M. v Angel V. , 99 AD3d at 249; see Matter of Raigosa v Zafirakopoulos , 167 AD3d at 749). 

Here, in light of the parties' conflicting allegations as to whether there was an ""intimate relationship"" between the child and the respondent within the meaning of Family Court Act ยง 812(1)(e), the Family Court, prior to determining whether it had subject matter jurisdiction, should have conducted a hearing on that issue ( see Matter of Rizzo v Pravato , 170 AD3d at 862; Matter of Gustavo D. v Michael D. , 146 AD3d 530 ; Matter of Singh v DiFrancisco , 141 AD3d 598, 598 ). 

Accordingly, we remit the matter to the Family Court, Kings County, for a hearing to determine whether the Family Court has subject matter jurisdiction under Family Court Act ยง 812(1)(e) and further proceedings thereafter, if warranted. In light of the foregoing, we need not reach the petitioner's remaining contention."
4,"Bank of America, N.A., respondent, v Dale Bente, appellant, et al., defendants.","In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant Dale Bente appeals from (1) an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (S. Betsy Heckman Torres, J.), dated January 19, 2023, and (2) an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale (one paper) of the same court entered February 7, 2023. The order granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm a referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale and denied that defendant's cross-motion for leave to renew her opposition to those branches of the plaintiff's prior motion which were for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against her and for an order of reference, which had been granted in an order of the same court (Howard H. Heckman, Jr., J.) dated November 20, 2018. The order and judgment of foreclosure and sale, inter alia, confirmed the referee's report and directed the sale of the subject property. 

ORDERED that the appeal from the order dated January 19, 2023, is dismissed; and it is further, 

ORDERED that the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale is affirmed; and it is further, 

ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the plaintiff. The appeal from the order dated January 19, 2023, must be dismissed because the right of direct appeal therefrom terminated with the entry of the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale in the action ( see Matter of Aho , 39 NY2d 241, 248 ). The issues raised on the appeal from the order dated January 19, 2023, are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale ( see CPLR 5501[a][1]). In March 2017, the plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose a mortgage against the defendant Dale Bente (hereinafter the defendant), among others. The plaintiff subsequently moved, inter alia, for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendant and for an order of reference. In support of its motion, the plaintiff submitted, among other things, an affidavit of an assistant vice president of the plaintiff, who, based upon her review of the plaintiff's business records, inter alia, attested to the defendant's default in payment. In an order dated November 20, 2018, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted those branches of the plaintiff's motion. In February 2022, the plaintiff moved to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion and cross-moved for leave to renew her opposition to those branches of the plaintiff's prior motion which were for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against her and for an order of reference. The defendant's cross-motion was based on a purported change in the law with respect to establishing a defendant's default in payment. In an order dated January 19, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion and denied the defendant's cross-motion. Subsequently, in an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale entered February 7, 2023, the court, inter alia, confirmed the referee's report and directed the sale of the subject property. 

The defendant appeals. The Supreme Court properly denied the defendant's cross-motion for leave to renew her opposition to those branches of the plaintiff's prior motion which were for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against her and for an order of reference, since the defendant failed to demonstrate that there had been a change in the law that would have altered the prior determination ( see CPLR 2221[e][2]; U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. v McCobb , 222 AD3d 696 ). In any event, contrary to the defendant's contention, the business records on which the plaintiff's assistant vice president relied in attesting to the defendant's default in payment were attached to the affidavit of the assistant vice president, and the records themselves evinced the defendant's default ( see Citigroup v Kopelowitz , 147 AD3d 1014, 1015 ). Further, the Supreme Court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. Contrary to the defendant's contention, the failure of the referee to conduct a hearing does not require reversal of the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale, as the defendant had the opportunity to raise questions and submit relevant evidence to the court ( see U.S. Bank N.A. v Mays , 221 AD3d 934 , 935; Wilmington Trust, N.A. v Reed , 210 AD3d 731 , 732). Moreover, the referee's findings with respect to the total amount due upon the mortgage were substantially supported by the record ( see Wilmington Trust, N.A. v Reed , 210 AD3d at 732)."
5,"Justin John Flood, etc., appellant, v Ritha Alhindawi, etc., et al., respondents.","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice, the plaintiff appeals from (1) an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Denise L. Sher, J.), entered January 24, 2023, and (2) an order of the same court entered January 26, 2023. The order entered January 24, 2023, insofar as appealed from, denied the plaintiff's cross-motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to the defendant Stephen Lastig. The order entered January 26, 2023, insofar as appealed from, denied the plaintiff's separate cross-motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to the defendant Ritha Alhindawi. 

ORDERED that the orders are affirmed insofar as appealed from, with one bill of costs. In May 2017, this action, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice was commenced against the defendants Ritha Alhindawi and Stephen Lastig (hereinafter together the defendants), among others. A note of issue was filed in January 2021. In July 2021, Alhindawi moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him, and Lastig separately moved, inter alia, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him. In May 2022, the plaintiff cross-moved for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Alhindawi and separately cross-moved for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Lastig. By order entered January 24, 2023, the Supreme Court, inter alia, denied the plaintiff's cross-motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Lastig. By order entered January 26, 2023, the court, among other things, denied the plaintiff's cross-motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Alhindawi. The plaintiff appeals from both orders. ""Leave to amend a bill of particulars is ordinarily to be freely given in the absence of prejudice or surprise"" ( Lorincz v Castellano , 208 AD3d 573 , 574; see J.D.R.G. v Golden Brick Dev. JP, LLC , 217 AD3d 846 , 848). ""However, once discovery has been completed and the case has been certified for trial, a party will not be permitted to amend the bill of particulars except upon a showing of special and extraordinary circumstances"" ( Lorincz v Castellano , 208 AD3d at 574-575; see Achee v Merrick Vil., Inc. , 208 AD3d 542 , 542-543). ""Where the motion for leave to amend a pleading is made long after the action has been certified for trial, judicial discretion in allowing such amendments should be discrete, circumspect, prudent, and cautious"" ( Lorincz v Castellano , 208 AD3d at 575 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""The determination to permit or deny the amendment is committed to the sound and broad discretion of the trial court, and its determination will not lightly be set aside"" ( Scopelliti v Westmed Med. Group , 193 AD3d 1009 , 1011). 

Here, the plaintiff failed to show special and extraordinary circumstances and failed to offer a reasonable excuse for his delay in seeking leave to amend the bills of particulars until 5 years after the commencement of this action, 1 year and 4 months after filing the note of issue, and 10 months after the defendants moved for summary judgment. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying the plaintiff's cross-motions for leave to amend the bills of particulars ( see J.D.R.G. v Golden Brick Dev. JP, LLC , 217 AD3d at 848; Lorincz v Castellano , 208 AD3d at 574-575; Scopelliti v Westmed Med. Group , 193 AD3d at 1011-1012)."
6,"Christian M. L. (Anonymous), etc. MercyFirst, respondent; Christopher M. L. (Anonymous), etc., et al., appellants. (Proceeding No. 1.) v Londyn M. L. (Anonymous), etc. MercyFirst, respondent; Christopher M. L. (Anonymous), etc., et al., appellants. (Proceeding No. 3.)","In related proceedings pursuant to Social Services Law ยง 384-b, the mother appeals, and the father separately appeals, from four orders of fact-finding and disposition of the Family Court, Queens County (Connie Gonzalez, J.) (one as to each child), all dated April 30, 2024. The orders of fact-finding and disposition, after fact-finding and dispositional hearings, found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the subject children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the subject children to the petitioner and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption. 

ORDERED that the orders of fact-finding and disposition are affirmed, without costs or disbursements. The petitioner, MercyFirst (hereinafter the agency), commenced these proceedings to terminate the parental rights of the mother and the father to the subject children on the ground of permanent neglect. Following fact-finding and dispositional hearings, the Family Court found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the children to the agency and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption. The mother and the father separately appeal. ""When a foster care agency brings a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the ground of permanent neglect, it must, as a threshold matter, prove by clear and convincing evidence that it has fulfilled its statutory duty to exercise diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parent-child relationship"" ( Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d 732 , 733 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Naijah-S.G.B. [Thomas X.B.] , 230 AD3d 1314 , 1314). ""Those efforts must include counseling, making suitable arrangements for parental access, providing assistance to the parents to resolve the problems preventing the child's discharge, and advising the parents of the child's progress and development"" ( Matter of Christopher C. [Sonia C.] , 235 AD3d 865 , 856 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 733). Once the agency demonstrates that it made diligent efforts to strengthen the parental relationship, it bears the burden of proving ""by clear and convincing evidence, that for a period of one year following the child's placement with the agency, the parent failed to maintain contact with the child or, alternatively, failed to plan for the future of the child, although physically and financially able to do so"" ( Matter of Daniel J.L. [Sayid L.] , 213 AD3d 939 , 940; see Social Services Law ยง 384-b[7][a]). ""A parent who has only partially complied with his or her service plan and who has not gained insight into the issues that caused the removal of the child has not planned for the child's future"" ( Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 733). 

Here, the agency met its burden of establishing that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children. The agency demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that it made diligent efforts to strengthen each parent's relationship with the children by formulating a service plan that served each parent's needs, providing referrals to programs, explaining the importance of compliance with the service plan, and facilitating parental access between the parents and the children. Moreover, the record shows that the parents failed to plan for the children's futures, despite the agency's diligent efforts, as they only partially complied with their service plans ( see Matter of Damaris E.A. [Johanna A.M.] , 217 AD3d 860 , 861; Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 734). 

Accordingly, the Family Court properly found that the parents permanently neglected the children. The evidence adduced at the dispositional hearing established that termination of the parental rights of the mother and the father was in the best interests of the children ( see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d 913 , 914; Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d 730 , 731). Contrary to the mother's contention, a suspended judgment would not be in the children's best interests, as such a disposition would ""only prolong the delay of stability and permanenc[y]"" in the children's lives ( Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d at 732; see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d at 914-915). Further, the record supports the Family Court's determination that the children's best interests would be served by freeing them for adoption by their respective foster parents, with whom each child has bonded and resided with over a prolonged period of time ( see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d at 915; Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d at 732)."

However, no appeal lies from an order refusing to sign an order to show cause, as it is an ex parte order that does not decide a motion made on notice (CPLR 5701[a][2]; see Schwartz v Noll , 191 AD3d 567 , 567 [1st Dept 2021], lv dismissed 39 NY3d 948 [2022])."

White, J.), dated October 6, 2023. The order continued the placement of the child in the custody of the Commissioner of Social Services of the City of New York until the next permanency hearing or further order of the court. Assigned counsel has submitted a brief in accordance with Anders v California ( 386 US 738 ), in which he moves for leave to withdraw as counsel for the appellant. 

ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed as academic, without costs or disbursements; and it is further, 

ORDERED that counsel's application for leave to withdraw as counsel for the appellant is denied as academic. The mother's appeal from the order must be dismissed as academic, since that order was superseded by an order dated January 25, 2024, awarding custody of the subject child to the paternal grandmother ( see Matter of Agam B. [Janna W.] , 143 AD3d 702, 702-703 ). Furthermore, the child is now 18 years old and is no longer subject to the custody and parental access provisions of the order ( see Family Ct Act ยง 119[c]; Matter of Skye H. , 195 AD3d 711 , 712-713).

9,"Daniel L. Boldi, admitted as Daniel Louis Boldi, an attorney and counselor-at-law. Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District, petitioner; Daniel L. Boldi, respondent. (Attorney v )","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for unpaid wages in violation of Labor Law article 19, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Lisa A. Cairo, J.), dated September 15, 2023. The order granted the defendants' motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the amended complaint. 

ORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting those branches of the defendants' motion which were pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint, and substituting therefor a provision denying those branches of the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was formerly employed as a delivery driver by the defendant Krystal Fruits & Vegetables, Inc. (hereinafter Krystal). In January 2023, the plaintiff commenced this action against Krystal and its owner, the defendant Michael Longo, among other things, to recover damages for unpaid wages and failure to provide wage statements in violation of the Labor Law. The defendants moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1) and (7) to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiff opposed the motion and filed an amended complaint. In an order dated September 15, 2023, the Supreme Court considered the defendants' motion as directed against the amended complaint and granted the motion. The plaintiff appeals. We modify. ""On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), the complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction, the facts alleged are presumed to be true, the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of every favorable inference, and the court is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory"" ( Gorbatov v Tsirelman , 155 AD3d 836, 837 ; see MJ Lilly Assoc., LLC v Ovis Creative, LLC , 221 AD3d 805 , 807). ""Where evidentiary material is submitted and considered on a motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), and the motion is not converted into one for summary judgment, the question becomes whether the plaintiff has a cause of action, not whether the plaintiff has stated one and, unless it has been shown that a material fact as claimed by the plaintiff to be one is not a fact at all and unless it can be said that no significant dispute exists regarding it, dismissal should not eventuate"" ( Agai v Liberty Mut. Agency Corp. , 118 AD3d 830, 832; see Guggenheimer v Ginzburg , 43 NY2d 268, 275 ). ""A motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1) may be granted only if the documentary evidence submitted by the moving party utterly refutes the factual allegations of the complaint and conclusively establishes a defense to the claims as a matter of law"" ( MJ Lilly Assoc., LLC v Ovis Creative, LLC , 221 AD3d at 806 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see 533 Park Ave. Realty, LLC v Park Ave. Bldg. & Roofing Supplies, LLC , 156 AD3d 744, 746 ). ""[T]o be considered 'documentary,' evidence must be unambiguous and of undisputed authenticity"" ( Fontanetta v John Doe 1 , 73 AD3d 78, 86 ; see MJ Lilly Assoc., LLC v Ovis Creative, LLC , 221 AD3d at 806). 

Here, accepting the allegations in the amended complaint as true and according the plaintiff the benefit of every favorable inference, the first through third causes of action adequately stated causes of action to recover damages for unpaid wages and overtime compensation ( see Cabrera v Deadwood Constr., Inc. , 226 AD3d 743 , 744), as well as failure to pay spread-of-hours compensation ( see 12 NYCRR 142-2.4). Additionally, the fifth cause of action in the amended complaint, which alleged, inter alia, that the plaintiff's wage statements inaccurately reflected the hours that he worked, stated a cognizable cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 195(3) ( see Cabrera v Deadwood Constr., Inc. , 226 AD3d at 744; Silvers v Jamaica Hosp. , 218 AD3d 817 , 819). Moreover, the evidentiary proof submitted by the defendants did not establish, with respect to the first through third and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint, that a material fact as claimed by the plaintiff is not a fact at all and that no significant dispute exists regarding it ( see Kings Harbor Multicare Ctr. v Townes , 231 AD3d 936 , 938-939). Further, the Supreme Court should have denied dismissal of the first through third and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1). Contrary to the defendants' contention, the plaintiff's pay stubs and handwritten records of his hours worked, the accuracy of which is in dispute, did not utterly refute the plaintiff's factual allegations and conclusively establish a defense to the first through third and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint as a matter of law ( see Sobel v Ansanelli , 98 AD3d 1020, 1022 ). However, the Supreme Court properly granted dismissal of the fourth cause of action in the amended complaint, alleging a failure to provide wage notices in violation of Labor Law ยง 195(1), pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1). In support of their motion, the defendants submitted wage notices containing the plaintiff's electronic signature confirming receipt thereof. The wage notices, the authenticity of which the plaintiff did not dispute, utterly refuted the plaintiff's allegations that he never received wage notices as required by the Labor Law ( see Giambrone v Arnone, Lowth, Wilson, Leibowitz, Adriano & Greco , 197 AD3d 459 , 461-462)."
10,"Angel I. Rodriguez, petitioner, v New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, et al., respondents.","Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Charles S. Lopresto, J.), rendered January 9, 2020, convicting him of rape in the first degree, sexual abuse in the first degree, rape in the third degree, and criminal contempt in the second degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. Contrary to the defendant's contention, the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence. ""Weight of the evidence review requires a court first to determine whether an acquittal would not have been unreasonable"" ( People v Ford , 233 AD3d 891 , 893 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Abellard , 189 AD3d 1605 , 1606). An acquittal would not have been unreasonable 

here, so this Court ""must weigh conflicting testimony, review any rational inferences that may be drawn from the evidence and evaluate the strength of such conclusions"" ( People v Branch , 186 AD3d 1705 , 1706 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""Based on the weight of the credible evidence, the court then decides whether the jury was justified in finding the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"" ( People v Abellard , 189 AD3d at 1606 [internal quotation marks omitted]). However, ""[g]reat deference is accorded to the jury's opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony, and observe demeanor"" ( People v Ford , 233 AD3d at 893; see People v Ruiz , 228 AD3d 785 , 785). Upon reviewing the record 

here, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence ( see People v Perez , 168 AD3d 988 , 988). Contrary to the defendant's contention, he was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel under the New York Constitution, since, viewing defense counsel's performance in its totality, counsel provided meaningful representation ( see People v Debillis , 40 NY3d 431 , 436). Further, the defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel under the United States Constitution ( see Strickland v Washington , 466 US 668 ). The defendant's contention that the Supreme Court erred in allowing the People to confer with a witness during trial is unpreserved for appellate review ( see People v Larregui , 164 AD3d 1622 , 1624) and, in any event, without merit ( see People v Branch , 83 NY2d 663, 667 ; Matter of Isaiah D. , 127 AD3d 1184, 1185 ). 

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment."
11,"Anthony Mancheno Granizo, appellant, v Krystal Fruits & Vegetables, Inc., et al., respondents.","Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County (David J. Kirschner, J.), rendered December 19, 2023, convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. The defendant's contention that he was deprived of his constitutional right to prepare a defense by the Supreme Court's denial of his request for an adjournment is not preserved for appellate review ( see People v Stewart , 222 AD3d 781 , 782; People v Cooper , 192 AD3d 823 , 823; People v Sullivan , 54 AD3d 882, 883 ). In any event, the contention is without merit. ""The decision to grant or deny an adjournment request is committed to the trial court's sound discretion"" ( People v Cooper , 192 AD3d at 823). However, where ""the protection of fundamental rights is involved, the trial court's discretion is 'more narrowly construed'"" ( People v Stewart , 89 AD3d 1044, 1044-1045 , quoting People v Spears , 64 NY2d 698, 700 ). 

Here, the court providently exercised its discretion in denying the defendant's request for an adjournment to review discovery material, as it was made on the eve of trial and no prejudice resulted, as the defendant had sufficient time to review the discovery material before the start of the People's case ( see People v Harris , 234 AD3d 872 , 872; People v Nelson , 189 AD3d 1080 , 1081). The defendant's contention that he was deprived of a fair trial due to the Supreme Court's admission of certain testimony pursuant to People v Molineux ( 168 NY 264 ) is without merit. ""Evidence of a crime or bad act may be admissible as evidence in the People's case-in-chief in the trial of another crime when it tends to establish a defendant's (1) intent, (2) motive, (3) knowledge, (4) common scheme or plan, or (5) identity"" ( People v Blackwell , 219 AD3d 619 , 621 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Molineux , 168 NY at 293 ; People v Espinal-Ramos , 225 AD3d 621 , 621-622). Further, ""[i]n certain circumstances, the purposes for which Molineux evidence may be used can include 'completing the narrative of the events charged in the indictment and providing necessary background information'"" ( People v Jones , 206 AD3d 671 , 673, quoting People v Harris , 117 AD3d 847, 854 ; see People v Morris , 21 NY3d 588, 594 ). ""If the proffered evidence is probative of a relevant issue, the court must then engage in a discretionary balancing of its probative value and the need for the evidence against the potential for prejudice to the defendant"" ( People v Bonich , 208 AD3d 679 , 680; see People v Morris , 21 NY3d at 595 ). 

Here, the elicited testimony that the defendant initiated a physical altercation with the witness before he showed up at the witness's home with a loaded gun, and that he then fired the gun twice in the witness's direction, was probative of the defendant's motive and intent to use that weapon unlawfully against the witness ( see Penal Law 265.03[1][b]; People v Herrera , 191 AD2d 585 ; People v Richardson , 148 AD2d 476, 477 ). In addition, the testimony regarding the physical altercation provided necessary background information and completed the narrative of events leading up to the charged crimes ( see People v Johnson , 137 AD3d 811, 812-813 ; People v Crevelle , 125 AD3d 995, 999 ). The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in determining that the probative value of this evidence outweighed the potential for prejudice to the defendant, and the limiting instruction given to the jury served to alleviate any potential prejudice resulting from the admission of the evidence ( see People v Blackwell , 219 AD3d at 621; People v Bonich , 208 AD3d at 680). The sentence imposed was not excessive ( see People v Suitte , 90 AD2d 80 )."
12,"The People of the State of New York, respondent, v Olger Macas, appellant.","In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (Lewis J. Lubell, J.), dated August 16, 2022. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint and denied that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was for leave to serve a late notice of claim. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. In August 2020, the plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries when she slipped and fell on wet carpet at the premises of the defendant, Westchester Medical Center (hereinafter WMC). On October 16, 2020, the plaintiff sent a letter (hereinafter the October 2020 letter) notifying WMC of her fall and her intention to commence an action to recover damages for personal injuries. The October 2020 letter stated, inter alia, the date and the address where the accident occurred. However, the October 2020 letter did not describe the exact location within WMC's premises where the accident occurred. On March 4, 2022, the plaintiff commenced this action against WMC. WMC moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) and (7) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred and for failure to state a cause of action. The plaintiff cross-moved, inter alia, for leave to serve a late notice of claim. In an order dated August 16, 2022, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted WMC's motion and denied that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion. The plaintiff appeals. General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(1)(a) requires a plaintiff to serve a notice of claim within 90 days after a claim arises as a condition precedent to commencement of a tort action against a municipal corporation. ""'[I]n determining compliance with the requirements of General Municipal Law ยง 50-e, courts should focus on the purpose served by a Notice of Claim: whether based on the claimant's description municipal authorities can locate the place, fix the time and understand the nature of the accident'"" ( T.N. v City of New York , 227 AD3d 815 , 816, quoting Brown v City of New York , 95 NY2d 389, 393 ; see Behrens v Town of Huntington , 230 AD3d 730 , 731-732). 

Here, the plaintiff contends that the October 2020 letter served as a valid notice of claim. However, the October 2020 letter failed to comply with the specificity requirements of General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(2), as it, inter alia, failed to describe the location of the plaintiff's accident with sufficient specificity, and thus, the October 2020 letter was insufficient to serve as a valid notice of claim ( see Behrens v Town of Huntington , 230 AD3d at 732). Furthermore, even taking into account Executive Order (A. Cuomo) No. 202.8 (9 NYCRR 8.202.8), which tolled certain statutes of limitation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic through November 4, 2020, the plaintiff only had 90 days after the toll was lifted, or until February 2, 2021, to serve a notice of claim, and she failed to do so. Therefore, the plaintiff failed to comply with the condition precedent of General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(1), as she failed to timely serve a notice of claim. ""In determining whether to grant a petition for leave to serve a late notice of claim or to deem a late notice of claim timely served nunc pro tunc, a court must consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, whether the municipality acquired actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim within 90 days after the claim arose or a reasonable time thereafter, whether the delay would substantially prejudice the municipality in its defense, and whether the petitioner demonstrated a reasonable excuse for the failure to serve a timely notice of claim"" ( Matter of Ionescu v City of New York , 230 AD3d 1143 , 1144; see General Municipal Law ยง 50-e[5]; Matter of Cleary v Nassau Health Care Corp. , 215 AD3d 958 , 959; Matter of Ibrahim v New York City Tr. Auth. , 202 AD3d 786 , 787). ""Neither the presence nor absence of any one factor is determinative, although it is generally recognized that the question of whether the municipality timely acquired actual knowledge is of great importance"" ( Matter of C.N. v City of New York , 208 AD3d 784 , 785; see I.N. v City of Yonkers , 203 AD3d 721 , 723). 

Here, the plaintiff failed to establish that WMC had actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim, failed to provide a reasonable excuse, and failed to establish that it would not substantially prejudice WMC in its defense if the late notice were allowed. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was for leave to serve a late notice of claim. Moreover, even assuming that the plaintiff satisfied General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(5), she then had one year and 90 days after the toll on the statute of limitations was lifted, or until February 2, 2022, to commence this action but did not do so until March 4, 2022, 30 days after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. Therefore, the Supreme Court properly granted WMC's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was time-barred. The plaintiff's remaining contentions are improperly raised for the first time on appeal."
13,"The People of the State of New York, respondent, v Shavarsh Migranyan, appellant.","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Orange County (Robert A. Onofry, J.), dated February 8, 2021. The order, insofar as appealed from, (1) granted the separate motions of the defendants Fabricant, Lipman & Frishberg, PLLC, and Neal D. Frishberg and the defendants McCabe & Mack, LLP, and David L. Posner pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them, (2) granted that branch of the motion of the defendants Greenwald Doherty, LLP, and Kevin M. Doherty which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against them, (3) granted that branch of the motion of the defendants Greenwald Doherty, LLP, and Kevin M. Doherty which was for certain injunctive relief to the extent of enjoining the plaintiff from commencing any new action pertaining to her removal as voluntary library trustee of the Town of Chester Library Board of Trustees without prior written permission of the Supreme Court, and (4), sua sponte, in effect, directed dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendants Sussman & Watkins, Michael H. Sussman, Goldberg Segalla, and Jonathan M. Bernstein. 

ORDERED that on the Court's own motion, the notice of appeal from so much of the order as, sua sponte, in effect, directed dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendants Sussman & Watkins, Michael H. Sussman, Goldberg Segalla, and Jonathan M. Bernstein is deemed to be an application for leave to appeal from that portion of the order, and leave to appeal is granted ( see CPLR 5701[c]); and it is further, 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from; and it is further, 

ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the respondents. In 2012, the plaintiff was appointed as a voluntary library trustee of the Town of Chester Library Board of Trustees (hereinafter the Library Board). In 2014, Maureen Jagos, the director of the Town of Chester Library (hereinafter the library), raised a complaint regarding the plaintiff's conduct, which resulted in an investigation conducted by Devora Lindeman of the defendant Greenwald Doherty, LLP (hereinafter Greenwald). Following the investigation, Lindeman issued a report containing her findings and recommendations. According to a report dated July 16, 2014 (hereinafter the Lindeman report), Lindeman found that Jagos's complaints were credible and recommended that the plaintiff be asked to resign or be offered managerial training and that the plaintiff be removed as trustee if she declined to resign or undergo training. In August 2014, the Library Board voted to remove the plaintiff from her position as voluntary library trustee. The plaintiff subsequently retained the defendant Michael H. Sussman of the defendant Sussman & Watkins (hereinafter together the Sussman defendants) to represent her in an action she commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of 42 USC ยง 1983 . The plaintiff commenced that action against (1) the Town of Chester and its Town Supervisor, Alex Jamieson, represented by the defendant Jonathan M. Bernstein of the defendant Goldberg Segalla (hereinafter together the Goldberg defendants), and (2) the Library Board and its President, Teresa Mallon, represented by the defendant David L. Posner of the defendant McCabe & Mack, LLP (hereinafter together the McCabe defendants). The plaintiff also retained the defendant Neal D. Frishberg of the defendant Fabricant, Lipman, and Frishberg, LLP (hereinafter together the Frishberg defendants), to represent her in an action she commenced in the New York Supreme Court to recover damages for defamation (hereinafter the defamation action). The plaintiff commenced the defamation action against, among others, Jamieson. The plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that Jamieson made false statements to a local newspaper and reporter regarding Lindeman's findings and that Lindeman did not, in actuality, find that Jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible. The plaintiff subsequently discharged the Frishberg defendants as her counsel in the defamation action and proceeded pro se. Thereafter, Jamieson and other defendants separately moved, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the defamation action insofar as asserted against each of them. In an affidavit submitted in support of Jamieson's motion, Lindeman averred, among other things, that the Lindeman report, which accompanied her affidavit and was initialed by her on each page, was authentic. In opposition to Jamieson's motion, the plaintiff asserted, inter alia, that the Lindeman report was a ""forgery"" and that an ""authentic"" report issued by Lindeman existed, which made findings in the plaintiff's favor. The plaintiff did not submit a copy of the alleged authentic report. In an order dated April 3, 2017, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the separate motions of Jamieson and other defendants, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the defamation action insofar as asserted against each of them. In that order, the court determined that ""[t]he defendants have conclusively established"" that Jamieson's statements regarding the Lindeman report were ""an accurate account of the report of the investigation conducted regarding the plaintiff."" In August 2020, the plaintiff commenced the instant action, inter alia, to recover damages for violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487 against the Sussman defendants, the Frishberg defendants, the Goldberg defendants, the McCabe defendants, and Greenwald and its partner, Kevin M. Doherty (hereinafter together the Greenwald defendants). The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the defendants colluded with each other to conceal the alleged authentic version of the Lindeman report and to present a fraudulent report that resulted in the plaintiff's removal as voluntary library trustee. Thereafter, the Frishberg defendants and the McCabe defendants separately moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them on the grounds, inter alia, that the action was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. In addition, the Greenwald defendants moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against them on those grounds and to enjoin the plaintiff ""from filing any further actions relating to her claim that the Lindeman Report exchange in her underlying action was fraudulent."" In an order dated February 8, 2021, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the motions of the Frishberg defendants, the McCabe defendants, and the Greenwald defendants, and, sua sponte, in effect, directed the dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the Sussman defendants and the Goldberg defendants. The plaintiff appeals. ""Collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue clearly raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party or those in privity, whether or not the tribunals or causes of action are the same"" ( Reid v Reid , 198 AD3d 993 , 994). ""'The two requirements for its application are: first, the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive in the present action, and second, the party to be precluded must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination'"" ( Cullen v Moschetta , 207 AD3d 699 , 700, quoting Matter of Abady , 22 AD3d 71, 81 ). ""'The party seeking to invoke collateral estoppel has the burden to show the identity of the issues, while the party trying to avoid application of the doctrine must establish the lack of a full and fair opportunity to litigate'"" ( Villaver v Paglinawan , 230 AD3d 533 , 535, quoting Matter of Dunn , 24 NY3d 699, 704 ). 

Here, the majority of the plaintiff's allegations in this action were premised on her claim that the Lindeman report was a forgery and that an authentic report existed that made findings in her favor. However, the Supreme Court, in the defamation action, determined that Jamieson's statements regarding the substance of the Lindeman report were accurate, including that Lindeman found that Jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible and that the plaintiff should be removed as voluntary library trustee if she declined to resign or receive managerial training. Thus, the moving defendants established that the accuracy of the Lindeman report, which the plaintiff challenges in this action, had been necessarily decided against her in the defamation action ( see Gold v Rothfeld , 220 AD3d 717 , 718; Manko v Gabay , 175 AD3d 484 , 486). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that she lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue ( see Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v McVicar , 203 AD3d 919 , 920; DeMartino v Lomonaco , 155 AD3d 686, 687 ). Furthermore, to the extent the plaintiff raised allegations that were not precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the Supreme Court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. ""'On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), the complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction, the facts alleged are presumed to be true, the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of every favorable inference, and the court is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory'"" ( Clevenger v Yuzek , 222 AD3d 931 , 934, quoting Gorbatov v Tsirelman , 155 AD3d 836, 837 ). Pursuant to Judiciary Law ยง 487, an attorney who is ""guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party"" is liable to the injured party for treble damages ( see Guliyev v Banilov & Assoc., P.C. , 221 AD3d 589 , 591). ""'A violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487 requires an intent to deceive'"" ( id. , quoting Moormann v Perini & Hoerger , 65 AD3d 1106, 1108 ). ""'Allegations regarding an act of deceit or intent to deceive must be stated with particularity'"" ( Guliyev v Banilov & Assoc., P.C. , 221 AD3d at 591, quoting Bill Birds, Inc. v Stein Law Firm, P.C. , 164 AD3d 635 , 637, affd 25 NY3d 173 ). Further, ""'an injury to the plaintiff resulting from the alleged deceitful conduct of the defendant attorney is an essential element of a cause of action based on a violation' of Judiciary Law ยง 487"" ( Maroulis v Sari M. Friedman, P.C. , 153 AD3d 1250, 1252 [alteration omitted], quoting Rozen v Russ & Russ, P.C. , 76 AD3d 965 , 968). ""Thus, to state a cause of action alleging a violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487, the plaintiff must 'plead allegations from which damages attributable to the defendants' conduct might be reasonably inferred'"" ( Maroulis v Sari M. Friedman, P.C. , 153 AD3d at 1252 , quoting Mizuno v Nunberg , 122 AD3d 594, 595 ). 

Here, the plaintiff failed to allege sufficiently specific facts from which it could be reasonably inferred either that the defendants acted with the requisite degree of scienter or that the alleged acts of deceit were the proximate cause of any injury to the plaintiff ( see Pinkesz Mut. Holdings, LLC v Pinkesz , 198 AD3d 693 , 697-698; Sammy v Haupel , 170 AD3d 1224 , 1225). Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in granting that branch of the Greenwald defendants' motion which was for certain injunctive relief to the extent of enjoining the plaintiff from commencing any new action pertaining to her removal as voluntary library trustee without prior written permission of the court ( see Monaco v Van Meerendonk , 222 AD3d 744 ). While ""public policy mandates free access to the courts,"" ""a litigant can forfeit that right by[, as 

here,] abusing the judicial process through vexatious litigation"" ( Rossrock Fund II, L.P. v Toledo , 186 AD3d 1441 , 1442 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Caesar v HSBC Bank USA, NA , 200 AD3d 842 , 843). The parties' remaining contentions either need not be reached in light of our determination or are without merit."
14,"Nebesia Walker-Little, appellant, v Westchester Medical Center, respondent.","In a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 6, the maternal grandfather appeals, and the subject child separately appeals, from an order of the Family Court, Suffolk County (Cheryl M. Helfer, Ct. Atty. Ref.), dated June 24, 2024. The order, after a hearing, denied the maternal grandfather's petition for custody of the subject child and dismissed the proceeding. 

ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the facts and in the exercise of discretion, without costs or disbursements, and the matter is remitted to the Family Court, Suffolk County, for a hearing to determine a custody award based upon the best interests of the subject child. The mother and the father have one child together, born in 2009. In 2014 or 2015, the father voluntarily left the child in the care of the mother, who was residing in the maternal grandfather's household. Between 2015 and 2018, the father was incarcerated but maintained some contact with the child. After the father's release, he assisted the mother and the child with moving out of the maternal grandfather's household, but the father continued to live apart from the mother and the child. The maternal grandfather continued assisting the mother in caring for the child and saw the child almost every day. In 2020, the father moved into a house near the maternal grandfather's residence, and the child started staying with the father overnight on a weekly basis. In June 2023, the mother was involved in a car accident and subsequently died from her injuries. On the night of the accident, a paternal uncle drove the child to the maternal grandfather's house, as the father was visiting his fiancรฉe in North Carolina, where he had been planning to relocate without the child. In July 2023, after the mother's death, the father decided to bring the child to North Carolina with him. After ascertaining the child's wishes, the maternal grandfather commenced this proceeding for custody of the child. After a hearing, in an order dated June 24, 2024, the Family Court denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding, determining that the maternal grandfather failed to establish the existence of extraordinary circumstances. The maternal grandfather and the child separately appeal. ""Pursuant to Domestic Relations Law ยง 72(2)(a), a grandparent has standing to seek custody of a child where the grandparent demonstrates the existence of extraordinary circumstances, such as 'surrender, abandonment, persisting neglect, unfitness, and unfortunate or involuntary disruption of custody over an extended period of time,' 'or other like extraordinary circumstances'"" ( Matter of Seltzer v Patterson , 193 AD3d 1057 , 1058 [citation omitted], quoting Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys , 40 NY2d 543, 544, 546 ). An ""extended disruption of custody"" between the child and the parent ""shall constitute an extraordinary circumstance"" (Domestic Relations Law ยง 72[2][a]). ""The statute defines 'extended disruption of custody' as including, but not limited to, 'a prolonged separation of the respondent parent and the child for at least twenty-four continuous months during which the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child and the child resided in the household of the petitioner grandparent or grandparents'"" ( Matter of Mooney v Mooney , 198 AD3d 784 , 785-786, quoting Domestic Relations Law ยง 72[2][b]). ""However, the statute does not preclude a court from finding the existence of extraordinary circumstances even if the prolonged separation lasted less than 24 months"" ( id. at 786). ""Moreover, lack of contact is not a separate element under th[e] statute, '[r]ather, the quality and quantity of contact between the parent and child are simply factors to be considered in the context of the totality of the circumstances when determining whether the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child, and whether the child actually resided with the grandparents for the required ""prolonged"" period of time'"" ( id. , quoting Matter of Suarez v Williams , 26 NY3d 440, 449 ). ""'Inasmuch as the Family Court is in the best position to evaluate the credibility, temperament, and sincerity of the parties, its determination should be set aside only if it lacks a sound and substantial basis in the record'"" ( Matter of Seltzer v Patterson , 193 AD3d at 1058, quoting Matter of Gonzalez v Pagan , 178 AD3d 1039 , 1040). 

Here, contrary to the Family Court's determination, the maternal grandfather sustained his burden of demonstrating the existence of extraordinary circumstances. The evidence at the hearing established that, even though the father had regular contact and parental access with the child, the maternal grandparents have taken care of the child for most of her life and provided her with stability. Additionally, the father allowed the mother and the maternal grandparents to assume control over, and responsibility for the care of, the child while the father assumed the role of a noncustodial parent, the child has developed a close relationship with her half-siblings and extended family in New York, and the child expressed a desire to continue residing with the maternal grandfather ( see Matter of Tuttle v Worthington , 219 AD3d 1142 , 1145; Matter of Mumford v Milner , 183 AD3d 893 , 895). 

Accordingly, since the Family Court did not reach the issue of whether an award of custody to the maternal grandfather was in the best interests of the child, a hearing is required to determine a custody award based upon the best interests of the child ( see Matter of Elisa F. v Daniel D. , 225 AD3d 695 , 697)."
15,"Mary Langton, appellant, v Sussman & Watkins, et al., respondents.","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for personal injuries, the defendant Roland Tucker appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Carmen Victoria St. George, J.), dated August 2, 2023. The order denied that defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs to the defendants-respondents. The plaintiff's decedent, Debbie Durham, was a passenger in a vehicle owned by Durham and operated by the defendant Roland Tucker (hereinafter the host vehicle) when it collided with a taxi operated by the defendant Thomas Giordano and owned by the defendant Southampton Management, Inc. The collision occurred on Sills Road, which was a two-way street with two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. Tucker was operating the host vehicle straight in the left northbound lane. Giordano exited from a driveway of a premises located on the west side of Sills Road, crossed the two southbound lanes, and collided with the host vehicle as he attempted to make a left turn to travel in a northerly direction. The front driver's side of the host vehicle collided with the front passenger side of the taxi. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, inter alia, to recover damages for personal injuries. Tucker moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him. In an order dated August 2, 2023, the Supreme Court denied Tucker's motion. Tucker appeals. ""There can be more than one proximate cause of an accident, and [g]enerally, it is for the trier of fact to determine the issue of proximate cause"" ( Richardson v Cablevision Sys. Corp. , 173 AD3d 1083 , 1084 [citations and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Saviano v TT of Massapequa, Inc. , 223 AD3d 851 , 852). Therefore, ""'[d]efendants moving for summary judgment in a negligence action arising out of an automobile accident have the burden of establishing, prima facie, that they were not at fault in the happening of the accident'"" ( Woods v Burgos , 220 AD3d 688 , 689, quoting Nesbitt v Gallant , 149 AD3d 763, 763 ; see Rogers v Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , 223 AD3d 689 , 691), ""or that the alleged negligence of another person was the 'sole proximate cause of the accident'"" ( Woods v Burgos , 220 AD3d at 689, quoting Brunson v Korkovilas , 208 AD3d 842, 843). Vehicle and Traffic Law ยง 1143 provides that ""[t]he driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a roadway from any place other than another roadway shall yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on the roadway to be entered or crossed"" ( see Rogers v Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , 223 AD3d at 691). ""While the driver with the right-of-way is entitled to assume that other drivers will obey the traffic laws requiring them to yield, the driver with the right-of-way also has an obligation to keep a proper lookout and see what can be seen through the reasonable use of his or her senses to avoid colliding with other vehicles"" ( Woods v Burgos , 220 AD3d at 689 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Richardson v Cablevision Sys. Corp. , 173 AD3d at 1085). 

Here, in support of his motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him, Tucker submitted, among other things, transcripts of his and of Giordano's deposition testimony. Tucker failed to establish, prima facie, that he was free from fault in the happening of the collision or that the alleged negligence of Giordano was the sole proximate cause of the collision ( see Tsarenkov v Rosenbaum , 231 AD3d 1184 , 1185; Brunson v Korkovilas , 208 AD3d at 842-843). Specifically, Tucker's own conflicting testimony raised triable issues of fact as to whether he failed to see what there was to be seen and exercised reasonable care to avoid the collision ( see Brunson v Korkovilas , 208 AD3d at 842-843; Fergile v Payne , 202 AD3d 928 , 930). Since Tucker failed to sustain his prima facie burden, we need not consider the sufficiency of the opposition papers ( see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr. , 64 NY2d 851, 853 ). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied Tucker's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him."
16,"Clifton C. (Anonymous), petitioner-appellant, v Tory P. R. (Anonymous), respondent-respondent; Jayia R. (Anonymous), nonparty-appellant.","Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the County Court, Suffolk County (Mark D. Cohen, J.), both rendered June 18, 2018, convicting him of burglary in the first degree under Indictment No. 2300/16, and burglary in the first degree under Indictment No. 1574/17, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences. 

ORDERED that the judgments are affirmed. The defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary in the first degree, in satisfaction of two indictments. As part of the plea agreement, the defendant waived his right to appeal. Contrary to the defendant's contention, the record demonstrates that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to appeal ( see People v Thomas , 34 NY3d 545 , 559-560; People v Barnes , 210 AD3d 792 , 792-793). The defendant's valid waiver of his right to appeal precludes appellate review of his challenge to the County Court's suppression determination ( see People v Vidal , 233 AD3d 1055 , 1055; People v Barnes , 210 AD3d at 793). By pleading guilty, the defendant forfeited review of any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that did not directly involve the plea-negotiation process and sentence ( see People v Petgen , 55 NY2d 529 , 535 n 3; People v Rodriquez , 194 AD3d 1078 ). To the extent that 

the defendant contends that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of his pleas or negotiate better pleas under the circumstances, such contention is without merit. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the federal constitution, ""the defendant must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness"" and ""that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense"" ( Strickland v Washington , 466 US 668, 687-688 ; see People v Ramroop , _____ AD3d _____, _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01647, *1). In the context of a plea, a defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the defendant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, or that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different ( see People v Ramroop , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01647 ; People v Alexander , 208 AD3d 1247 , 1249). Under the New York Constitution, a defendant must show that he or she was not afforded ""meaningful representation"" ( People v Baldi , 54 NY2d 137, 147 ), which also entails a two-pronged test. The first prong is identical to its federal counterpart ( see People v Galan , 116 AD3d 787, 789 ). The second prong is ""based on the fairness of the process as a whole rather than the impact of counsel's errors on the outcome of the case"" ( People v Parvez , 209 AD3d 885 , 886-887; see People v Caban , 5 NY3d 143, 156 ). 

Here, during the plea colloquy, the defendant stated that he was not a United States citizen, and defense counsel stated, ""I'm sorry, Your Honor. I didn't know that."" The County Court immediately addressed this by telling the defendant, ""I need to make sure you understand that your plea of guilty may subject you to or result in your deportation, exclusion from the United States, or denied naturalization. And . . . [because] this is a violent felony offense you will be deported as a result of this plea. Do you understand that?"" The defendant replied, ""Yes."" When the court asked the defendant if he wished to consult with an immigration attorney, he said, ""No."" Thereafter, the court, among other things, reiterated that the defendant would ""be deported as the result of this crime,"" and the defendant confirmed that he understood. Further, at the end of the plea proceeding, defense counsel indicated that, by that point, defense counsel had discussed the ""certainty of deportation"" with the defendant. Although defense counsel did not advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of his pleas prior to the plea proceeding, it is clear from the record that the County Court repeatedly advised the defendant that he would be deported as a consequence of pleading guilty, and the defendant confirmed that he understood ( see People v Facey , 180 AD3d 927 , 929). Under the circumstances, the defendant was indisputably aware of the possible immigration consequences of pleading guilty before he entered his pleas. 

Accordingly, the defendant cannot show prejudice resulting from defense counsel's failure to provide that advice prior to the plea proceeding ( see People v Ramroop , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01647 ; People v Facey , 180 AD3d at 929; see also People v Singh , 231 AD3d 749 , 750). Additionally, the defendant failed to demonstrate that an incentive to remain in the United States would have made it rational to reject a favorable plea offer ( see People v Facey , 180 AD3d at 929)."
17,"Talaya Harrington, etc., plaintiff-respondent, v Roland Tucker, appellant, Thomas Giordano, et al., defendants-respondents.","In an action to recover damages for negligence, the defendant appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Alexander M. Tisch, J.), dated November 22, 2022. The order denied the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant, Poly Prep Country Day School (hereinafter Poly Prep), pursuant to the Child Victims Act (hereinafter the CVA), which created a revival window for previously time-barred childhood sexual abuse claims ( see CPLR 214-g). Poly Prep moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred. In an order dated November 22, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the motion. Poly Prep appeals. ""On a motion to dismiss a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) as barred by the applicable statute of limitations, the defendant bears the initial burden of demonstrating, prima facie, that the time within which to commence the cause of action has expired"" ( Rubin v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 227 AD3d 741 , 742 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Schearer v Fitzgerald , 217 AD3d 980 , 981). 

Here, Poly Prep, which argued that the CVA violates the Due Process Clause of the New York Constitution, failed to meet its burden. ""CPLR 214-g, enacted as part of the CVA, provides a revival window for 'civil claims or causes of action alleging intentional or negligent acts or omissions that seek to recover for injuries suffered as a result of conduct which would constitute sex crimes, which conduct was committed against a child less than 18 years of age, for which the statute of limitations had already run'"" ( Feaster v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 227 AD3d 668 , 669, quoting S.H. v Diocese of Brooklyn , 205 AD3d 180 , 184; see Spira v National Council of Young Israel , 231 AD3d 987 , 988; Forbes v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 220 AD3d 750 , 751). ""[A] claim-revival statute will satisfy the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution if it was enacted as a reasonable response in order to remedy an injustice"" ( Matter of World Trade Ctr. Lower Manhattan Disaster Site Litig. , 30 NY3d 377, 400 ). Contrary to Poly Prep's contention, the revival of civil claims and causes of action pursuant to the CVA was a reasonable response to remedy the injustice to child sexual assault survivors caused by application of the relevant statute of limitations ( see Spira v National Council of Young Israel , 231 AD3d at 988; Feaster v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 227 AD3d at 669-670; Forbes v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 220 AD3d at 752; Schearer v Fitzgerald , 217 AD3d at 982-983). Poly Prep's remaining contention is without merit. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied Poly Prep's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred."

Nos. 2300/16, 1574/17)","Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Michael Aloise, J.), both rendered July 24, 2018, convicting him of burglary in the second degree (three counts) under Indictment No. 2833/16, and burglary in the second degree (two counts) under Indictment No. 2834/16, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences. 

ORDERED that the judgments are affirmed. The defendant's contention that his sentences as a persistent violent felony offender ( see Penal Law ยง 70.08) are unconstitutional in light of Erlinger v United States ( 602 US 821 ) is unpreserved for appellate review, as the defendant failed to raise a constitutional challenge before the Supreme Court ( see CPL 470.05[2]; People v Rosen , 96 NY2d 329, 335 ; People v Locenitt , 157 AD3d 905 , 907-908).

19,"P. A., respondent, v Poly Prep Country Day School, appellant.","In an action, inter alia, for a judgment declaring that certain beneficiary designations are null and void, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Paul M. Hensley, J.), dated May 30, 2023. The order granted the defendants' motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint. 

ORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the cause of action for a judgment declaring that certain beneficiary designations are null and void, and substituting therefor a provision denying that branch of the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff. The plaintiff is the daughter of Selma J. Rauch (hereinafter the decedent), who died in November 2022. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant Laura Rauch, the plaintiff's sister-in-law, and the defendants Jonathan Rauch, Jesse Rauch, and Jordan Rauch, Laura's sons, alleging, inter alia, that in 2016 and 2017, the defendants improperly influenced the decedent to name them as the beneficiaries of two accounts that contained an approximate total sum of $470,000. The plaintiff alleged that the beneficiary designations are void by reason of the defendants' undue influence over the decedent and the decedent's lack of capacity when the beneficiary designations were executed. The defendants moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint on the ground, among others, that it failed to state a cause of action. In opposition to the motion, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit in which she made statements to supplement the causes of action alleged in the complaint. In an order dated May 30, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the defendants' motion. The plaintiff appeals. ""On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), a court must accept the facts as alleged in the complaint as true, accord plaintiffs the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory"" ( Reaves v New York City Dept. of Educ. , 218 AD3d 697 , 698 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Connaughton v Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. , 29 NY3d 137, 141 ). ""'Whether the complaint will later survive a motion for summary judgment, or whether the plaintiff will ultimately be able to prove its claims, of course, plays no part in the determination of a prediscovery CPLR 3211 motion to dismiss'"" ( Perlov v Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J. , 189 AD3d 1624 , 1626, quoting Shaya B. Pac., LLC v Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, LLP , 38 AD3d 34, 38 ). Where a cause of action is based upon, inter alia, fraud, breach of trust, or undue influence, the circumstances constituting the wrong shall be stated in detail ( see CPLR 3016[b]). 

Here, the Supreme Court should have considered the plaintiff's affidavit to remedy any defects in the complaint when it assessed the defendants' motion ( see Leon v Martinez , 84 NY2d 83, 88 ; Hountenbous v Fordune Assn., Inc. , 200 AD3d 662 , 664). Contrary to the defendants' contention, the affidavit and the complaint alleged with sufficient detail facts to support a claim that the changes to the beneficiary designations of the decedent's accounts are void by virtue of undue influence exercised by the defendants over the decedent or the decedent's incapacity ( see Matter of Tognino , 87 AD3d 1153, 1155 ). 

Accordingly, the court erred in granting that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the cause of action for a judgment declaring that the beneficiary designations are null and void. However, the Supreme Court correctly determined that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently state causes of action alleging unjust enrichment ( see Nasca v Greene , 216 AD3d 648 , 650; Beaman v Awaye Realty Mgt., LLC , 176 AD3d 1025 , 1025) and to impose a constructive trust ( see Seidenfeld v Zaltz , 162 AD3d 929 , 936), as the plaintiff failed to allege that she conferred any benefit upon the defendants. Similarly, the court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for money had and received, as she failed to allege that the defendants received money belonging to her ( see Pacella v RSA Consultants, Inc. , 164 AD3d 806 , 808; Lebovits v Bassman , 120 AD3d 1198, 1199-1200 )."

The order dated May 10, 2023, denied the defendants' motion, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate so much of an order of the same court (Lawrence Knipel, J.) dated September 20, 2022, as granted that branch of the plaintiff's unopposed motion which was to preclude the defendants from offering evidence, testifying at trial, or submitting an affidavit in response to any dispositive motion. The order dated July 19, 2023, denied those branches of the defendants' motion which were for leave to reargue and renew their prior motion, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate so much of the order dated September 20, 2022, as granted that branch of the plaintiff's unopposed motion which was to preclude the defendants from offering evidence, testifying at trial, or submitting an affidavit in response to any dispositive motion. 

ORDERED that the appeal from so much of the order dated July 19, 2023, as denied that branch of the defendants' motion which was for leave to reargue is dismissed, as no appeal lies from an order denying reargument; and it is further, 

ORDERED that the order dated May 10, 2023, is affirmed; and it is further, 

ORDERED that the order dated July 19, 2023, is affirmed insofar as reviewed; and it is further, 

ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the plaintiff. On March 15, 2017, the plaintiff allegedly was injured when she fell on an ice condition in a parking lot owned by the defendants. In August 2017, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants to recover damages for personal injuries. In March 2022, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR 3126 to strike the defendants' answer or to preclude them from presenting any evidence or testifying at trial based upon their failure to timely appear for a deposition. In an order dated April 6, 2022, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion to the extent of directing the defendants to, among other things, appear for a deposition by May 25, 2022, and that the defendants' failure to comply therewith would result in the defendants being precluded from offering evidence, testifying at trial, or submitting an affidavit in response to any dispositive motion. The defendants failed to appear for a deposition by May 25, 2022. In August 2022, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, to preclude the defendants from offering evidence, testifying at trial, or submitting an affidavit in response to any dispositive motion. The defendants failed to oppose the motion. In an order dated September 20, 2022, the court, among other things, granted that branch of the plaintiff's motion. In January 2023, the defendants moved, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate so much of the order dated September 20, 2022, as granted that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was to preclude the defendants from offering evidence, testifying at trial, or submitting an affidavit in response to any dispositive motion. In an order dated May 10, 2023, the Supreme Court denied the motion. Thereafter, the defendants moved, inter alia, for leave to reargue and renew their prior motion, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate the subject portion of the order dated September 20, 2022. In an order dated July 19, 2023, the court denied those branches of the defendants' motion which were for leave to reargue and renew. The defendants appeal from the orders dated May 10, 2023, and July 19, 2023. The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying the defendants' motion, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate so much of the order dated September 20, 2022, as granted that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was to preclude the defendants from offering evidence, testifying at trial, or submitting an affidavit in response to any dispositive motion. ""A party seeking to vacate an order entered upon his or her default in opposing a motion must submit evidence in admissible form establishing both a reasonable excuse for the default and a potentially meritorious opposition to the motion"" ( Saleh v Hudson 418 Riv. Rd., Ltd. , 225 AD3d 812 , 813). ""A court 'has discretion to accept law office failure as a reasonable excuse where the claim is supported by a detailed and credible explanation of the default'"" ( id. at 814 , quoting Bank of N.Y. Mellon Trust Co. N.A. v Hsu , 204 AD3d 874 , 876). ""'However, law office failure should not be excused . . . where allegations of law office failure are vague, conclusory, and unsubstantiated'"" ( id. , quoting Glukhman v Bay 49th St. Condominium, LLC , 100 AD3d 594, 595 ). 

Here, the defendants' excuse of law office failure was vague and conclusory, and therefore, insufficient to establish a reasonable excuse for their failure to oppose the plaintiff's August 2022 motion ( see U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. v Aulder , 219 AD3d 666 , 667; Wright v Brooklyn Renaissance Funding Co., LLC , 174 AD3d 676 , 677). Since the defendants failed to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for not opposing the motion, it is unnecessary to determine whether they established a potentially meritorious opposition to the motion ( see Rudsky v Schechtman , 219 AD3d 1453 , 1455). Furthermore, the Supreme Court properly denied that branch of the defendants' motion which was for leave to renew their prior motion, in effect, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a) to vacate the subject portion of the order dated September 20, 2022. ""Pursuant to CPLR 2221, a motion for leave to renew 'shall be based upon new facts not offered on the prior motion that would change the prior determination' (CPLR 2221[e][2]) and 'shall contain reasonable justification for the failure to present such facts on the prior motion' (CPLR 2221[e][3])"" ( Nunez v U.S. Bank N.A. , 194 AD3d 944 , 946; see Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v Galloway , 214 AD3d 625 , 626). ""A motion for leave to renew is not a second chance freely given to parties who have not exercised due diligence in making their first factual presentation"" ( Groman v Fleyshmakher , 221 AD3d 789 , 790 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""While a court has discretion to entertain renewal based on facts known to the movant at the time of the original motion, the movant must set forth a reasonable justification for the failure to submit the information in the first instance"" ( id. [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""When no reasonable justification is given for failing to present new facts on the prior motion, the Supreme Court lacks discretion to grant renewal"" ( id. [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

Here, the defendants failed to offer any excuse, let alone a reasonable justification, for failing to submit the purportedly new facts and evidence on their prior motion ( see Bockstruck v Town of Islip , 219 AD3d 439 , 442-443; Robert v Azoulay Realty Corp. , 209 AD3d 781 , 786). Moreover, the defendants failed to demonstrate that the purportedly new facts and evidence provided a basis to change the court's prior determination ( see Robert v Azoulay Realty Corp. , 209 AD3d at 786; Josovich v Ceylan , 133 AD3d 570, 572 ). The parties' remaining contentions either need not be reached in light of our determination or are without merit."
21,"Linda Rauch, appellant, v Laura Rauch, et al., respondents.","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Linda Kevins, J.), dated December 6, 2021. The order granted the motion of the defendant Reinaldo Figueroa pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction and denied the plaintiff's cross-motion pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the summons and complaint upon that defendant. 

ORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting the motion of the defendant Reinaldo Figueroa pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction, and substituting therefor a provision denying the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff. On March 4, 2020, the plaintiff, as parent and natural guardian of the infant N. J. G., commenced this action, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice, alleging that the defendants rendered negligent care and treatment during the pregnancy and delivery of the infant. The defendant Reinaldo Figueroa (hereinafter the defendant) served an answer and subsequently moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction due to defective service of process. In support of the motion, the defendant submitted an affidavit of service sworn to on March 24, 2020, in which the process server described the defendant as ""[a] Connecticut corporation"" and attested that service was effectuated on the defendant by serving ""Donald F. Keene JD,"" as ""Authorized Agent"" thereof ( cf. id. ยง 311[a][1]). In opposition to the motion, the plaintiff submitted an amended affidavit of service in which the process server attested that service was effectuated upon the defendant on March 24, 2020, pursuant to CPLR 308(2) by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to Keene, a person of suitable age and discretion, at the defendant's actual place of business and by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant at his actual place of business. In addition, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit of service sworn to on January 25, 2021, in which the process server attested that service was effectuated upon the defendant on January 7, 2021, pursuant to CPLR 308(2) by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to ""Denise Cotto"" at the defendant's actual place of business and by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the defendant at his actual place of business. The plaintiff argued that the service on January 7, 2021, was timely pursuant to Executive Order (A. Cuomo) No. 202.8 (9 NYCRR 8.202.8). Alternatively, the plaintiff cross-moved pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the summons and complaint upon the defendant. In an order dated December 6, 2021, the Supreme Court granted the defendant's motion and denied the plaintiff's cross-motion. The plaintiff appeals. Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the amended affidavit of service could not cure the deficiencies in the original affidavit of service, regardless of whether leave to amend the proof of service was sought ( see id. ยง 305[c]; John Doe v Mesivtha, Inc. , 226 AD3d 971 , 973; HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Rini , 218 AD3d 664 ; Jampolskaya v Ilona Genis, MD, P.C. , 205 AD3d 785 , 787). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court erred in granting the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction. Service of a summons and complaint must be made within 120 days after commencement of the action ( see CPLR 306-b). On March 20, 2020, on which date the time for the plaintiff to serve process had not lapsed, former Governor Andrew M. Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.8, which tolled ""any specific time limit for the commencement, filing, or service of any legal action, notice, motion, or other process or proceeding, as prescribed by the procedural laws of the state, including but not limited to . . . the civil practice law and rules"" ( see Blue Lagoon, LLC v Reisman , 214 AD3d 938 , 942). The former Governor issued a series of nine subsequent executive orders that continued the toll that was put in place by Executive Order 202.8 through November 3, 2020 ( see Brash v Richards , 195 AD3d 582 , 583-584). ""A toll . . . suspends the running of the applicable statute of limitations for a finite . . . time period,"" and ""the period of the toll is excluded from the calculation of the [relevant time period]"" ( Chavez v Occidental Chem. Corp. , 35 NY3d 492 , 505 n 8; see Brash v Richards , 195 AD3d at 582). 

Here, in opposition to the defendant's motion, the plaintiff demonstrated that the 120-day period ( see CPLR 306-b) had not expired when the defendant was served pursuant to CPLR 308(2) on January 7, 2021, such that the service was timely ( see Cruz v Guaba , 226 AD3d 964 , 965; Baker v 40 Wall St. Holdings Corp. , 226 AD3d 637 , 638). As a consequence, ""[t]he plaintiff's re-service of the summons and complaint during the pendency of the defendant's motion 'effectively obviated his jurisdictional objection to the action against him, and constituted prima facie evidence of proper service pursuant to CPLR 308(2)'"" ( Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams. v Marous , 186 AD3d 669 , 671-672, quoting Rosenberg v Trazzera , 147 AD3d 1099, 1101 ; see Bank of Am., N.A. v Valentino , 127 AD3d 904, 904 ). In response, the defendant failed to rebut the prima facie proof of proper service set forth in the affidavit of service sworn to on January 25, 2021 ( see Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams. v Marous , 186 AD3d at 672; Rosenberg v Trazzera , 147 AD3d at 1101 ; Bank of Am., N.A. v Valentino , 127 AD3d at 904 ). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have denied the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him for lack of personal jurisdiction. In light of our determination, it is not necessary to consider the plaintiff's remaining contentions."
22,"The FG&N Trust, Plaintiff-Respondent, v 165 Housing Corp., et al., Defendants-Appellants.","In a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 6, the mother appeals from an order of the Family Court, Nassau County (Darlene D. Harris, J.), dated August 8, 2024. The order dismissed the mother's petition for custody of the parties' child for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs or disbursements. The mother and the father have one child. In September 2023, the father filed a petition for custody of the child in the State of Connecticut. In October 2023, the parties entered into a temporary custody agreement, which was approved by the Superior Court, State of Connecticut (hereinafter the Connecticut court), awarding them joint legal and physical custody of the child and setting forth a parental access schedule. On June 21, 2024, the mother commenced this proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 6 for custody of the child. After a conference at which the Family Court conferred with the Connecticut court, the Family Court dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The mother appeals. Contrary to the mother's contention, the Family Court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine the petition. The record is clear that the State of Connecticut has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the custody dispute, as the father continued to reside in Connecticut and the Connecticut court had not declined jurisdiction ( see Domestic Relations Law ยง 76-b; Conn Gen Stat Ann ยงยง 46b-115aa, 46b-115l[a]; Matter of Etzel v Freleng , 188 AD3d 1054 , 1055; Matter of Renaud v Barnett , 174 AD3d 906 ). Moreover, contrary to the mother's contention, there was no evidence before the Family Court that the father posed a risk of harm to the child so as to warrant the exercise of the court's temporary emergency jurisdiction pursuant to Domestic Relations Law ยง 76-c ( see Matter of Chavez v Maldonado , 213 AD3d 757 , 759; Matter of Hearne v Hearne , 61 AD3d 758, 759 ). The mother's remaining contentions are without merit."
23,"Frances Agostinacchio, respondent, v Jofaz Transportation, Inc., et al., appellants.","In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (Alexandra D. Murphy, J.), dated May 31, 2023. The order granted the motion of the defendants County of Westchester and Westchester County Department of Parks and Recreation and Conservation for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them. 

ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the motion of the defendants County of Westchester and Westchester County Department of Parks and Recreation and Conservation for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them is denied. The plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries he allegedly sustained when he fell while riding his bicycle after colliding with the arm of a toll booth at the North White Plains train station parking lot. Thereafter, the defendants County of Westchester and Westchester County Department of Parks and Recreation and Conservation (hereinafter together the defendants) moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them. In an order dated May 31, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the motion. The plaintiff appeals. ""Owners and parties in possession of a property are under a duty to maintain their property in a reasonably safe condition in view of the existing circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk"" ( Smith v Dutchess Motor Lodge , 213 AD3d 881 , 882; see Saunders v Nostrand 1543, LLC , 230 AD3d 1261 , 1262). ""In a premises liability case, a defendant property owner or occupant who moves for summary judgment has the initial burden of making a prima facie showing that it neither created the alleged defective condition nor had actual or constructive notice of its existence"" ( Curto v Kahn Prop. Owner, LLC , 225 AD3d 660 , 660 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""Generally, the issue of whether a dangerous or defective condition exists depends on the facts of each case and is a question of fact for the jury"" ( Snyder v AFCO Avports Mgt., LLC , 232 AD3d 209 , 212-213; see Trincere v County of Suffolk , 90 NY2d 976, 977 ). However, a property owner has ""no duty to protect or warn against an open and obvious condition that, as a matter of law, is not inherently dangerous"" ( Cortes v King Kullen Grocery Co., Inc. , 210 AD3d 949 , 950 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Cerrato v Jacobs , 173 AD3d 1134 , 1135). ""A condition is open and obvious if it is readily observable by those employing the reasonable use of their senses, given the conditions at the time of the accident"" ( Rider v Manhattan Monster, Inc. , 208 AD3d 807 , 808 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""The determination of whether an asserted hazard is open and obvious cannot be divorced from the surrounding circumstances, and whether a condition is not inherently dangerous, or constitutes a reasonably safe environment, depends on the totality of the specific facts of each case"" ( id. [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Papetti v City of Long Beach , 227 AD3d 919 , 920). ""A condition that is ordinarily apparent to a person making reasonable use of his or her senses may be rendered a trap for the unwary where the condition is obscured or the plaintiff is distracted"" ( Sebagh v Capital Fitness, Inc. , 202 AD3d 853 , 855 [internal quotation marks omitted]). Thus, ""[t]he issue of whether a condition is open and obvious and not inherently dangerous is case-specific, and usually a question of fact for a jury"" ( Kean-Chong v MBA-Vernon Blvd., LLC , 228 AD3d 851 , 852 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Graffino v City of New York , 162 AD3d 990 , 991). 

Here, the defendants' submissions failed to establish, prima facie, that, based on the surrounding circumstances as they existed at the time of the accident, the toll arm was open and obvious and not inherently dangerous ( see Johnson v 1451 Assoc., L.P. , 225 AD3d 752 , 753-754; Evans v Fields , 217 AD3d 656 , 657). Notably, the accident occurred on one of the first nights that the toll arm was left in a downward position and, according to the plaintiff, it had ""blended"" in with the background to the extent that the plaintiff did not see it until ""inches"" before hitting it. Moreover, the only photographs included in the defendants' motion papers were of poor quality and little probative value ( see Louima v Jims Realty, LLC , 125 AD3d 943, 944 ). The defendants also failed to demonstrate, prima facie, that they did not create the alleged defective condition or that they did not have actual or constructive notice of the condition's existence ( see Parrinello v Independence Plaza SC, LLC , 189 AD3d 1441 , 1443). Since the defendants failed to satisfy their prima facie burden, the Supreme Court should have denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them without regard to the sufficiency of the plaintiff's opposition papers ( see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr. , 64 NY2d 851, 853 ). The defendants' remaining contention is without merit."

25,"Kristin M. Cirillo, appellant, v Ronald Grullon, respondent.","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Orange County (Robert A. Onofry, J.), dated February 8, 2021. The order, insofar as appealed from, (1) granted the separate motions of the defendants Fabricant, Lipman & Frishberg, PLLC, and Neal D. Frishberg and the defendants McCabe & Mack, LLP, and David L. Posner pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them, (2) granted that branch of the motion of the defendants Greenwald Doherty, LLP, and Kevin M. Doherty which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against them, (3) granted that branch of the motion of the defendants Greenwald Doherty, LLP, and Kevin M. Doherty which was for certain injunctive relief to the extent of enjoining the plaintiff from commencing any new action pertaining to her removal as voluntary library trustee of the Town of Chester Library Board of Trustees without prior written permission of the Supreme Court, and (4), sua sponte, in effect, directed dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendants Sussman & Watkins, Michael H. Sussman, Goldberg Segalla, and Jonathan M. Bernstein. 

ORDERED that on the Court's own motion, the notice of appeal from so much of the order as, sua sponte, in effect, directed dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendants Sussman & Watkins, Michael H. Sussman, Goldberg Segalla, and Jonathan M. Bernstein is deemed to be an application for leave to appeal from that portion of the order, and leave to appeal is granted ( see CPLR 5701[c]); and it is further, 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from; and it is further, 

ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the respondents. In 2012, the plaintiff was appointed as a voluntary library trustee of the Town of Chester Library Board of Trustees (hereinafter the Library Board). In 2014, Maureen Jagos, the director of the Town of Chester Library (hereinafter the library), raised a complaint regarding the plaintiff's conduct, which resulted in an investigation conducted by Devora Lindeman of the defendant Greenwald Doherty, LLP (hereinafter Greenwald). Following the investigation, Lindeman issued a report containing her findings and recommendations. According to a report dated July 16, 2014 (hereinafter the Lindeman report), Lindeman found that Jagos's complaints were credible and recommended that the plaintiff be asked to resign or be offered managerial training and that the plaintiff be removed as trustee if she declined to resign or undergo training. In August 2014, the Library Board voted to remove the plaintiff from her position as voluntary library trustee. The plaintiff subsequently retained the defendant Michael H. Sussman of the defendant Sussman & Watkins (hereinafter together the Sussman defendants) to represent her in an action she commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of 42 USC ยง 1983 . The plaintiff commenced that action against (1) the Town of Chester and its Town Supervisor, Alex Jamieson, represented by the defendant Jonathan M. Bernstein of the defendant Goldberg Segalla (hereinafter together the Goldberg defendants), and (2) the Library Board and its President, Teresa Mallon, represented by the defendant David L. Posner of the defendant McCabe & Mack, LLP (hereinafter together the McCabe defendants). The plaintiff also retained the defendant Neal D. Frishberg of the defendant Fabricant, Lipman, and Frishberg, LLP (hereinafter together the Frishberg defendants), to represent her in an action she commenced in the New York Supreme Court to recover damages for defamation (hereinafter the defamation action). The plaintiff commenced the defamation action against, among others, Jamieson. The plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that Jamieson made false statements to a local newspaper and reporter regarding Lindeman's findings and that Lindeman did not, in actuality, find that Jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible. The plaintiff subsequently discharged the Frishberg defendants as her counsel in the defamation action and proceeded pro se. Thereafter, Jamieson and other defendants separately moved, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the defamation action insofar as asserted against each of them. In an affidavit submitted in support of Jamieson's motion, Lindeman averred, among other things, that the Lindeman report, which accompanied her affidavit and was initialed by her on each page, was authentic. In opposition to Jamieson's motion, the plaintiff asserted, inter alia, that the Lindeman report was a ""forgery"" and that an ""authentic"" report issued by Lindeman existed, which made findings in the plaintiff's favor. The plaintiff did not submit a copy of the alleged authentic report. In an order dated April 3, 2017, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the separate motions of Jamieson and other defendants, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the defamation action insofar as asserted against each of them. In that order, the court determined that ""[t]he defendants have conclusively established"" that Jamieson's statements regarding the Lindeman report were ""an accurate account of the report of the investigation conducted regarding the plaintiff."" In August 2020, the plaintiff commenced the instant action, inter alia, to recover damages for violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487 against the Sussman defendants, the Frishberg defendants, the Goldberg defendants, the McCabe defendants, and Greenwald and its partner, Kevin M. Doherty (hereinafter together the Greenwald defendants). The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the defendants colluded with each other to conceal the alleged authentic version of the Lindeman report and to present a fraudulent report that resulted in the plaintiff's removal as voluntary library trustee. Thereafter, the Frishberg defendants and the McCabe defendants separately moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them on the grounds, inter alia, that the action was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. In addition, the Greenwald defendants moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against them on those grounds and to enjoin the plaintiff ""from filing any further actions relating to her claim that the Lindeman Report exchange in her underlying action was fraudulent."" In an order dated February 8, 2021, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the motions of the Frishberg defendants, the McCabe defendants, and the Greenwald defendants, and, sua sponte, in effect, directed the dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the Sussman defendants and the Goldberg defendants. The plaintiff appeals. ""Collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue clearly raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party or those in privity, whether or not the tribunals or causes of action are the same"" ( Reid v Reid , 198 AD3d 993 , 994). ""'The two requirements for its application are: first, the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive in the present action, and second, the party to be precluded must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination'"" ( Cullen v Moschetta , 207 AD3d 699 , 700, quoting Matter of Abady , 22 AD3d 71, 81 ). ""'The party seeking to invoke collateral estoppel has the burden to show the identity of the issues, while the party trying to avoid application of the doctrine must establish the lack of a full and fair opportunity to litigate'"" ( Villaver v Paglinawan , 230 AD3d 533 , 535, quoting Matter of Dunn , 24 NY3d 699, 704 ). 

Here, the majority of the plaintiff's allegations in this action were premised on her claim that the Lindeman report was a forgery and that an authentic report existed that made findings in her favor. However, the Supreme Court, in the defamation action, determined that Jamieson's statements regarding the substance of the Lindeman report were accurate, including that Lindeman found that Jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible and that the plaintiff should be removed as voluntary library trustee if she declined to resign or receive managerial training. Thus, the moving defendants established that the accuracy of the Lindeman report, which the plaintiff challenges in this action, had been necessarily decided against her in the defamation action ( see Gold v Rothfeld , 220 AD3d 717 , 718; Manko v Gabay , 175 AD3d 484 , 486). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that she lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue ( see Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v McVicar , 203 AD3d 919 , 920; DeMartino v Lomonaco , 155 AD3d 686, 687 ). Furthermore, to the extent the plaintiff raised allegations that were not precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the Supreme Court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. ""'On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), the complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction, the facts alleged are presumed to be true, the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of every favorable inference, and the court is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory'"" ( Clevenger v Yuzek , 222 AD3d 931 , 934, quoting Gorbatov v Tsirelman , 155 AD3d 836, 837 ). Pursuant to Judiciary Law ยง 487, an attorney who is ""guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party"" is liable to the injured party for treble damages ( see Guliyev v Banilov & Assoc., P.C. , 221 AD3d 589 , 591). ""'A violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487 requires an intent to deceive'"" ( id. , quoting Moormann v Perini & Hoerger , 65 AD3d 1106, 1108 ). ""'Allegations regarding an act of deceit or intent to deceive must be stated with particularity'"" ( Guliyev v Banilov & Assoc., P.C. , 221 AD3d at 591, quoting Bill Birds, Inc. v Stein Law Firm, P.C. , 164 AD3d 635 , 637, affd 25 NY3d 173 ). Further, ""'an injury to the plaintiff resulting from the alleged deceitful conduct of the defendant attorney is an essential element of a cause of action based on a violation' of Judiciary Law ยง 487"" ( Maroulis v Sari M. Friedman, P.C. , 153 AD3d 1250, 1252 [alteration omitted], quoting Rozen v Russ & Russ, P.C. , 76 AD3d 965 , 968). ""Thus, to state a cause of action alleging a violation of Judiciary Law ยง 487, the plaintiff must 'plead allegations from which damages attributable to the defendants' conduct might be reasonably inferred'"" ( Maroulis v Sari M. Friedman, P.C. , 153 AD3d at 1252 , quoting Mizuno v Nunberg , 122 AD3d 594, 595 ). 

Here, the plaintiff failed to allege sufficiently specific facts from which it could be reasonably inferred either that the defendants acted with the requisite degree of scienter or that the alleged acts of deceit were the proximate cause of any injury to the plaintiff ( see Pinkesz Mut. Holdings, LLC v Pinkesz , 198 AD3d 693 , 697-698; Sammy v Haupel , 170 AD3d 1224 , 1225). Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in granting that branch of the Greenwald defendants' motion which was for certain injunctive relief to the extent of enjoining the plaintiff from commencing any new action pertaining to her removal as voluntary library trustee without prior written permission of the court ( see Monaco v Van Meerendonk , 222 AD3d 744 ). While ""public policy mandates free access to the courts,"" ""a litigant can forfeit that right by[, as 

here,] abusing the judicial process through vexatious litigation"" ( Rossrock Fund II, L.P. v Toledo , 186 AD3d 1441 , 1442 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Caesar v HSBC Bank USA, NA , 200 AD3d 842 , 843). The parties' remaining contentions either need not be reached in light of our determination or are without merit."
26,"Richard Velazquez, appellant, v County of Westchester, et al., respondents, et al., defendant.","In an action to recover damages for employment discrimination in violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC ยง 2000e et seq. ) and the New York State Human Rights Law (Executive Law ยง 296[1][a]), the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (David F. Everett, J.), dated April 27, 2023. The order granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. In August 2018, the plaintiff was hired by the defendant as a phlebotomist, subject to a six-month probationary period. On January 15, 2019, the plaintiff was informed that her employment was terminated. In September 2019, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for employment discrimination. The amended complaint, filed in November 2019, alleged that the defendant discriminated against the plaintiff in violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter title VII) (42 USC ยง 2000e et seq. ) and the New York State Human Rights Law (hereinafter the NYSHRL) (Executive Law ยง 296[1][a]) by terminating her employment based upon her pregnancy. The defendant moved for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint. In an order dated April 27, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the motion. The plaintiff appeals. The NYSHRL makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual or to discharge such a person from employment on the basis of the individual's gender ( see id. ; Golston-Green v City of New York , 184 AD3d 24 , 34). ""Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is a form of gender discrimination"" ( Golston-Green v City of New York , 184 AD3d at 34; see Lefort v Kingsbrook Jewish Med. Ctr. , 203 AD3d 708 , 709). The standards for establishing unlawful discrimination under the NYSHRL previously were the same as those governing title VII cases ( see Rainer N. Mittl, Ophthalmologist, P.C. v New York State Div. of Human Rights , 100 NY2d 326, 330 ; Ferrante v American Lung Assn. , 90 NY2d 623, 629 ). In 2019, however, the New York State Legislature amended the NYSHRL, in pertinent part, to require that it ""be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the remedial purposes thereof, regardless of whether federal civil rights laws, including those laws with provisions worded comparably to the provisions of this article, have been so construed"" (Executive Law ยง 300; L 2019, ch 160, ยง 6; see Golston-Green v City of New York , 184 AD3d at 35 n 1). That amendment was effective August 12, 2019 ( see L 2019, ch 160, ยง 16), and applies to causes of action, like the instant cause of action, that are filed on or after the effective date ( see id. ยง 16[d]; Elco v Aguiar , 226 AD3d 649 , 651; Golston-Green v City of New York , 184 AD3d at 35 n 1). As a result of the amendment, the NYSHRL now aligns with the standards of the New York City Human Rights Law (hereinafter the NYCHRL) ( see Administrative Code of City of NY ยง 8-130[a], [b]; Syeed v Bloomberg L.P. , 41 NY3d 446 , 451; Cannizzaro v City of New York , 82 Misc 3d 563 , 577 [Sup Ct, NY County]; Stickler v IBM, Inc. , 2024 WL 3952639 , *2 n 4, 2024 US Dist LEXIS 154797 , *4 n 4 [SD NY, No. 22-CV-2449 (KMW)]; Harlow v Molina Healthcare, Inc. , 723 F Supp 3d 116, 129 n 6[ND NY]). Under the NYCHRL, unlawful discrimination must play ""no role"" in an employment decision ( Singh v Covenant Aviation Sec., LLC , 131 AD3d 1158, 1161 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Lefort v Kingsbrook Jewish Med. Ctr. , 203 AD3d at 711-712). Thus, a defendant's motion for summary judgment must be analyzed under both the familiar framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v Green ( 411 US 792 ) and under the newer mixed-motive framework, which imposes a lesser burden on a plaintiff opposing such a motion ( see Reichman v City of New York , 179 AD3d 1115 , 1117; Ellison v Chartis Claims, Inc. , 178 AD3d 665 , 668; Hamburg v New York Univ. Sch. of Medicine , 155 AD3d 66, 72-73 ). ""A defendant must make 'a prima facie showing that there is no evidentiary route that could allow a jury to believe that discrimination played a role in their challenged actions'"" ( Ellison v Chartis Claims, Inc. , 178 AD3d at 668, quoting Cenzon-Decarlo v Mount Sinai Hosp. , 101 AD3d 924 , 927; see Lefort v Kingsbrook Jewish Med. Ctr. , 203 AD3d at 712). ""A plaintiff may defeat summary judgment by coming forward either with evidence that the defendant's stated reasons were a pretext for discrimination or with evidence that discrimination was one of the motivating factors for the defendant's conduct"" ( Ellison v Chartis Claims, Inc. , 178 AD3d at 668; see Hamburg v New York Univ. Sch. of Medicine , 155 AD3d at 73 ). Applying these principles 

here, we conclude that the defendant established its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law dismissing the cause of action alleging a violation of the NYSHRL by demonstrating that there was no evidentiary route that could allow a jury to find that discrimination played a role in the decision to terminate the plaintiff's employment ( cf. Ellison v Chartis Claims, Inc. , 178 AD3d at 668; Kosarin-Ritter v Mrs. John L. Strong, LLC , 117 AD3d 603, 604 ). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the proffered explanations were a pretext for discrimination or whether discrimination was one of the motivating factors for the challenged action ( cf. Ellison v Chartis Claims, Inc. , 178 AD3d at 669; Hamburg v New York Univ. Sch. of Medicine , 155 AD3d at 76 ). The plaintiff offered nothing but speculation that the decision to terminate her employment was motivated, even in part, by unlawful discrimination, which is insufficient to defeat summary judgment ( see Ellison v Chartis Claims, Inc. , 178 AD3d at 669). The plaintiff's remaining contention is without merit. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the amended complaint."
27,"The People of the State of New York, respondent, v Ronald Gladden, appellant.","Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Lewis J. Lubell, J.), entered November 8, 2021, declaring that the lien of The Dakota, Inc. is superior to that of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., unanimously modified, on the law, and The Dakota's lien declared superior only to the extent of $592,189.69, and otherwise affirmed, without costs. Appeal from order, same court and Justice, entered on or about August 4, 2021, which granted The Dakota's summary judgment motion and denied Chase's summary judgment motion, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as subsumed in the appeal from the judgment. At issue on remand from the Court of Appeals ( Matter of Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, LLP v JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , โ NY3d โ, 2024 NY Slip Op 05876 , [2024], revg 209 AD3d 529 [1st Dept 2022]) is Chase's challenge to the award of attorneys' fees to The Dakota in prior litigation initiated by its former shareholder-tenant Alphonse Fletcher, Jr. The proprietary lease between The Dakota and Fletcher states that The Dakota would be entitled to attorneys' fees ""[i]f the Lessee shall at any time be in default hereunder, and the Lessor shall take any action against the Lessee based upon such default, or if the Lessor shall defend any action or proceeding (or claim therein) commenced by the Lessee."" This provision makes clear that attorneys' fees are to be awarded under two circumstances: first, when the lessee is in default; second, whenever a lessee sues The Dakota, even if The Dakota is in default. Because the lease provides for attorneys' fees regardless of default or merit, in a dispute between a residential co-op and a shareholder tenant, we find this provision to be unenforceable as unconscionable ( compare Matter of Krodel v Amalgamated Dwellings Inc. , 166 AD3d 412 , 413-414 [1st Dept 2018] [finding similar provision unconscionable in a dispute between those types of parties], lv denied 33 NY3d 910 [2019], with Glaze Teriyaki LLC v MacArthur Props. I LLC , 206 AD3d 513 , 513 [1st Dept 2022] [finding attorneys' fee provision enforceable in dispute with commercial tenant ""(i)n light of the fact that the parties to the lease are sophisticated entities that negotiated the lease terms through counsel""]). The lease is not ""silent as to whether such right is contingent upon the merits of plaintiff's action"" ( Firemen's Assn. of the State of N.Y. v 99 Washington, LLC , 73 AD3d 1320, 1322 [3d Dept 2010]), but explicitly provides for attorneys' fees whenever the tenant sues The Dakota. This interpretation is not changed by the description of the fees as ""reasonable"" ( see Krodel , 166 AD3d at 412 [interpreting a provision that provided for ""reasonable legal fees""]). ""Bearing in mind that agreements providing for payment of attorneys' fees should be construed strictly"" ( Andrews 44 Coffee Shops Inc. v TST/TMW 405 Lexington, L.P. , 40 AD3d 544, 545 [1st Dept 2007]), we will not rewrite the parties' agreement simply because The Dakota prevailed in the underlying litigation ( see Krodel , 166 AD3d at 412-413 [affirming dismissal of counterclaim for attorneys' fees prior to resolution of the merits]).""To enforce such a provision would produce an unjust result because it would dissuade aggrieved parties from pursuing litigation and preclude tenant-shareholders from making meaningful decisions about how to vindicate their rights in legitimate instances of landlord default"" ( Krodel , 166 AD3dat 414). Chase now concedes that The Dakota's lien has priority insofar as it is based on charges unrelated to the disputed claim for legal fees, and that those unrelated charges come to $592,189.69. Therefore, the judgment is modified to that extent. The Decision and Order of this Court entered herein on January 28, 2025 is hereby recalled and vacated ( see M-1174 decided simultaneously herewith)."

In April 2018, the petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 52, seeking, inter alia, the turnover of a safety deposit box maintained by the respondents Zakhar Brener and Ninel Krepkina and of certain residential real property owned by the respondent B and K Trust. The petitioner sought to satisfy a judgment dated November 15, 2017, against the respondent Affordable Shoes, Ltd. (hereinafter Affordable Shoes), and Brener in the total sum of $338,778.72, which was the result of a default by Affordable Shoes on a commercial lease and a default by Brener on an associated personal guaranty. The petition alleged that in January 2014, Brener fraudulently conveyed the real property to B and K Trust, an entity of which Brener and Krepkina, his long-term partner, are cotrustees. The petitioner moved for summary judgment on the petition. Brener, Krepkina, Affordable Shoes, and B and K Trust (hereinafter collectively the Brener respondents) opposed the petitioner's motion.

""Pursuant to the version of Debtor and Creditor Law ยง 273 applicable at the time of the subject conveyance[ ], a conveyance that renders the conveyor insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to actual intent, if the conveyance was made without fair consideration"" ( Louis Monteleone Fibres, Ltd. v Hudson Baylor Brookhaven, LLC , 228 AD3d 641 , 645; see Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 273 [as added by L 1925, ch 254, ยง 1, repealed by L 2019, ch 580, ยง 2, eff Apr. 4, 2020]; Board of Mgrs. of E. Riv. Tower Condominium v Empire Holdings Group, LLC , 175 AD3d 1377 , 1378). ""To constitute fair consideration, the value given in exchange must be fairly equivalent and proportionate to the value of the property conveyed"" ( Cheek v Brooks , 188 AD3d 785 , 786; see Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 272; Louis Monteleone Fibres, Ltd. v Hudson Baylor Brookhaven, LLC , 228 AD3d at 646). ""Insolvency within the meaning of the Debtor and Creditor Law occurs when 'the present fair salable value of [the debtor's] assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay [the] probable liability on . . . existing debts as they become absolute and matured'"" ( Palmerone v Staples , 195 AD3d 736 , 738, quoting Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 271[1]; see Grace Plaza of Great Neck v Heitzler , 2 AD3d 780, 781 ). ""In general, the burden of proving insolvency is on the party challenging the conveyance.

Here, the petitioner established her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the cause of action seeking relief pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 273 by submitting evidence that Brener was insolvent at the time of the conveyance of the property, which was made without fair consideration ( see Palmerone v Staples , 195 AD3d at 738; Cheek v Brooks , 188 AD3d at 786). In opposition, the Brener respondents failed to raise a triable issue of fact. Furthermore, the petitioner established her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the cause of action seeking relief pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 276. ""Pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 276, every conveyance made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors is fraudulent.

""In determining whether a conveyance was fraudulent, the courts consider the existence of certain common 'badges of fraud,' which include 'a close relationship between the parties to the alleged fraudulent transaction; a questionable transfer not in the usual course of business; inadequacy of the consideration; the transferor's knowledge of the creditor's claim and the inability to pay it; and retention of control of the property by the transferor after the conveyance'"" ( Corning Fed. Credit Union v Georgilis , 217 AD3d 828 , 831, quoting Goldenberg v Friedman , 191 AD3d at 643-644; see Pen Pak Corp. v LaSalle Natl. Bank of Chicago , 240 AD2d 384, 386 ).

Here, the petitioner submitted, among other things, the Brener respondents' answer, wherein they admitted that Brener continued to occupy and use the property with Krepkina. In opposition, the Brener respondents failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the transfer was in the usual course of business. In addition, the petitioner established her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the cause of action to direct Chase Bank to turn over of the contents of the safe deposit box maintained by Brener and Krepkina by submitting a letter establishing that Brener and Krepkina jointly held a safe deposit box at one of Chase Bank's branches in Brooklyn ( see Matter of Wells Fargo Vendor Fin.

29,"Ayiesha Wright, appellant, v White Plains Hospital Medical Center, respondent.","In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the defendant appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Randy Sue Marber, J.), entered June 20, 2023. The order granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability and denied the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. 

ORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, and substituting therefor a provision denying the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the defendant. The plaintiff allegedly was injured at the defendant's vehicle repair shop when she attempted to exit from the customer waiting area to the parking lot through an open garage door, rather than an exterior door, and the garage door suddenly fell on her. The plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability, based on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and the defendant cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. By order entered June 20, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion and denied the defendant's cross-motion. 

The defendant appeals. ""The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur permits an inference of negligence to be drawn solely from the happening of an accident"" ( Giantomaso v T. Weiss Realty Corp. , 142 AD3d 950, 952 ; see Morejon v Rais Constr. Co. , 7 NY3d 203, 205-206 ). It requires evidence of an event which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of negligence, was caused by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant, and was not due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff ( see Cantey v City of New York , 184 AD3d 618 ; Bunting v Haynes , 104 AD3d 715 ). ""Since the circumstantial evidence allows but does not require the jury to infer that the defendant was negligent, res ipsa loquitur evidence does not ordinarily or automatically entitle the plaintiff to summary judgment, even if the plaintiff's circumstantial evidence is unrefuted"" ( Giantomaso v T. Weiss Realty Corp. , 142 AD3d at 952 ). Summary judgment on the issue of liability should only be granted ""in the rarest of res ipsa loquitur cases"" where ""the plaintiff's circumstantial proof is so convincing and the defendant's response so weak that the inference of [the] defendant's negligence is inescapable"" ( Morejon v Rais Constr. Co. , 7 NY3d at 209 ; see Barney-Yeboah v Metro-North Commuter R.R. , 25 NY3d 945, 946 ). 

Here, the plaintiff did not establish, by sufficiently convincing circumstantial proof, ""that the inference of [the] defendant's negligence is inescapable"" ( Morejon v Rais Constr. Co. , 7 NY3d at 209 ; see Hoeberlein v Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. , 124 AD3d 722, 722-723 ). Specifically, the plaintiff failed to submit sufficiently convincing circumstantial proof that the garage door and its mechanism were within the defendant's exclusive control, and that the accident was not due to any fault on the part of the plaintiff ( see Cantey v City of New York , 184 AD3d at 619; Dilligard v City of New York , 170 AD3d 955 , 956-957; Brennan v Wappingers Cent. Sch. Dist. , 164 AD3d 640 , 641-642; Bunting v Haynes , 104 AD3d at 716 ). ""'In those cases where conflicting inferences may be drawn, choice of inference must be made by the jury'"" ( Dilligard v City of New York , 170 AD3d at 956 [internal quotation marks omitted], quoting Kambat v St. Francis Hosp. , 89 NY2d 489, 495 ). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability without regard to the sufficiency of the opposition papers ( see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr. , 64 NY2d 851, 853 ). However, the Supreme Court properly denied the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, as the defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of entitlement to such relief ( see id. )."

Saitta, J.), dated December 15, 2022. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied those branches of the plaintiffs' motion which were for a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from signing checks or documents on behalf of the defendant E & S Realty Management, LLC, and to appoint a receiver. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. In August 2017, the plaintiffs commenced this action, inter alia, pursuant to RPAPL article 15 to quiet title to real property located in Brooklyn (hereinafter the property). The complaint alleged, among other things, that the signature of the plaintiff Mordechai Hersh Malek had been forged on a May 2001 deed, which purportedly conveyed the property to the plaintiff E & S Realty Trust, and that the signatures of the other grantors, including the defendants Shulem Malek, Chaim Hillel Malek, and Chaya Sura Radzminsky, had also been forged. The complaint sought, among other relief, to cancel the May 2001 deed, as well as a November 2007 deed purportedly conveying the property to the defendant E & S Realty Management, LLC (hereinafter E & S Realty Management). The plaintiffs subsequently moved, inter alia, for a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from selling or transferring the property, altering the ownership of E & S Realty Management and/or the property, and signing checks or documents on behalf of E & S Realty Management, and to appoint a receiver for the property and E & S Realty Management. In an order dated December 15, 2022, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was for a preliminary injunction only to the extent of enjoining the defendants from selling or transferring the property and the ownership interests of E & S Realty Management during the pendency of the action. The court also denied those branches of the motion which were for a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from signing checks or documents on behalf of E & S Realty Management and to appoint a receiver. The plaintiffs appeal. CPLR 6401(a) permits the court, upon a motion by a person with an ""apparent interest"" in property, to appoint a temporary receiver of that property, inter alia, where ""there is danger"" that it will be ""lost, materially injured or destroyed"" ( see Rozenberg v Perlstein , 200 AD3d 915 , 920). However, ""[t]he appointment of a temporary receiver is an extreme remedy resulting in the taking and withholding of possession of property from a party without an adjudication on the merits"" ( Vardaris Tech, Inc. v Paleros Inc. , 49 AD3d 631, 632 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Rozenberg v Perlstein , 200 AD3d at 920). Therefore, ""[a] party moving for the appointment of a temporary receiver must submit 'clear and convincing evidence of irreparable loss or waste to the subject property and that a temporary receiver is needed to protect their interests'"" ( Board of Mgrs. of Nob Hill Condominium Section II v Board of Mgrs. of Nob Hill Condominium Section I , 100 AD3d 673 , 673, quoting Natoli v Milazzo , 65 AD3d 1309, 1310 ; see Rozenberg v Perlstein , 200 AD3d at 920). 

Here, the plaintiffs failed to make such a clear evidentiary showing ( see Manning-Kranes v Manning-Franzman , 175 AD3d 1403 ; Board of Mgrs. of Nob Hill Condominium Section II v Board of Mgrs. of Nob Hill Condominium Section I , 100 AD3d at 673). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of the plaintiffs' motion which was for the appointment of a receiver for the property and E & S Realty Management. ""To establish the right to a preliminary injunction, a movant must demonstrate (1) the likelihood of success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction, and (3) that the equities balance in the movant's favor"" ( Benaim v S2 Corona, LLC , 214 AD3d 760 , 761; see CPLR 6301; Braunstein v Hodges , 157 AD3d 850 ). ""The decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the court hearing the motion"" ( Benaim v S2 Corona, LLC , 214 AD3d at 761; see Cong. Machon Chana v Machon Chana Women's Inst., Inc. , 162 AD3d 635 , 637). ""Absent unusual or compelling circumstances, appellate courts are reluctant to disturb that determination"" ( Cong. Machon Chana v Machon Chana Women's Inst., Inc. , 162 AD3d at 637; see Cushing v Sanford Equities Corp. , 223 AD3d 870 , 871). 

Here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of the plaintiffs' motion which was for a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from signing checks or documents on behalf of E & S Realty Management. The plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable injury absent the preliminary injunction ( see Benaim v S2 Corona, LLC , 214 AD3d at 761). The plaintiffs' remaining contention is without merit."
31,"Deborah Schiffman, etc., appellant, v Affordable Shoes, Ltd., et al., respondents- respondents, et al., respondent.","In an action to recover damages pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 USC ยง 1692 et seq. ), the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (David T. Reilly, J.), dated January 9, 2023. The order granted the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(3) to dismiss the complaint. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. In July 2018, the defendant, a law firm specializing in debt collection, sent the plaintiff a notice seeking to collect upon an alleged debt he owed to a third party (hereinafter the notice). The plaintiff then commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (hereinafter the federal action), alleging that the defendant violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( 15 USC ยง 1692 et seq. ; hereinafter FDCPA) by issuing the notice ( see Green v Forster & Garbus, LLP , 2021 WL 8087869 , *1, 2021 US Dist LEXIS 203571 , *1 [ED NY, No. 19-CV-3550 (JS)(SIL)], report and recommendation rejected 2022 WL 939743 , 2022 US Dist LEXIS 57675 [ED NY, No. 19-CV-3550 (JS)(SIL)]). Following the dismissal of the federal action on the ground that he lacked article III standing ( see Green v Forster & Garbus, LLP , 2022 WL 939743 , *2-4, 2022 US Dist LEXIS 57675 , *2-9), the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant. In the complaint, the plaintiff asserted that the notice violated the FDCPA because it was ""confus[ing] . . . as to the identity of the creditor,"" without asserting that it caused him any actual damages. In May 2022, the defendant moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(3) to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff lacked standing. The plaintiff opposed the motion. By order dated January 9, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the defendant's motion. The plaintiff appeals. ""Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977 . . . to eliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that debt collectors who abstain from such practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers"" ( Jerman v Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L.P.A. , 559 US 573, 577 , citing 15 USC ยง 1692 [e]; see 12 CFR 1006.1[b]). The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from engaging in certain practices, such as ""mak[ing] false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with a debt"" ( Obduskey v McCarthy & Holthus LLP , 586 US 466 , 474; see Heintz v Jenkins , 514 US 291, 292-293 ). To achieve its goals, ""[t]he [FDCPA] imposes civil liability on debt collectors"" who engage in ""prohibited . . . practices"" ( Jerman v Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L.P.A. , 559 US at 576 [alterations and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Henson v Santander Consumer USA Inc. , 582 US 79 , 81). ""The FDCPA's private cause of action . . . provides that a person may recover 'any actual damage sustained by such person as a result of' an FDCPA violation and 'such additional damages as the court may allow'"" ""subject to [a] statutory cap[ ]"" of $1,000 ( Trichell v Midland Credit Mgt., Inc. , 964 F3d 990 , 994, 1000 [11th Cir], quoting 15 USC ยง 1692k[a][1], [2][A]), as well as costs and ""a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court"" (15 USC ยง 1692k[a][3]). ""Under the common law, . . . a court has no inherent power to right a wrong unless thereby the civil, property[,] or personal rights of the plaintiff . . . are affected"" ( Society of Plastics Indus. v County of Suffolk , 77 NY2d 761, 772 [internal quotation marks omitted]). Therefore, ""a court can act only when the rights of the party requesting relief are affected and that party has an actual legal stake in the matter being adjudicated"" ( Tilcon N.Y., Inc. v Town of New Windsor , 172 AD3d 942 , 944 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""[A] plaintiff, in order to have standing in a particular dispute, must demonstrate an injury in fact that falls within the relevant zone of interests sought to be protected by law"" ( Caprer v Nussbaum , 36 AD3d 176, 183 ; see Donnelly v Teachers Fed. Credit Union , 228 AD3d 831 , 832). ""The injury-in-fact requirement"" of common-law standing ""necessitates a showing that the party . . . has suffered a cognizable harm that is not tenuous, ephemeral, or conjectural but is sufficiently concrete and particularized to warrant judicial intervention"" ( Matter of Mental Hygiene Legal Serv. v Daniels , 33 NY3d 44 , 50 [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Festa v Town of Oyster Bay , 210 AD3d 678 , 679-680). ""Where a defendant seeks dismissal pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(3) based on lack of standing, the burden is on the moving defendant to establish, prima facie, the plaintiff's lack of standing"" ( Fossella v Adams , 225 AD3d 98 , 108 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""To defeat a defendant's motion to dismiss, the plaintiff has no burden of establishing its standing as a matter of law, but must merely raise a question of fact as to the issue"" ( Sizova v Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. , 217 AD3d 1007 , 1008 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Wilmington Trust, N.A. v Teo , 204 AD3d 735 , 736-737). 

Here, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the defendant established, prima facie, that the plaintiff lacked common-law standing to pursue his FDCPA cause of action ( see Kraus v Credit Control Servs., Inc. , ____ AD3d ____ [decided herewith]; Sikh Forum, Inc. v Saluja , 227 AD3d 1024 , 1025). The plaintiff failed to allege facts demonstrating an injury-in-fact, since he merely asserted, without more, that the notice was confusing as to the identity of the creditor ( see Society of Plastics Indus. v County of Suffolk , 77 NY2d at 772 ; Nettles v Midland Funding LLC , 983 F3d 896 , 899-900 [7th Cir]; Adams v Skagit Bonded Collectors, LLC , 836 Fed Appx 544 , 547 [9th Cir]). In opposition to the defendant's prima facie showing, the plaintiff failed to raise a question of fact ( see Sizova v Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. , 217 AD3d at 1008). To the extent the plaintiff contends that he possessed statutory standing under the FDCPA, separate and distinct from common-law standing ( see generally Matter of Harkenrider v Hochul , 38 NY3d 494 , 508; Rudder v Pataki , 93 NY2d 273, 278-281 ; Westchester County Dept. of Pub. Safety Police Benevolent Assn., Inc. v Westchester County , 35 AD3d 592, 594 ), this contention is improperly raised for the first time on appeal ( see Kraus v Credit Control Servs., Inc. , ____ AD3d ____ [decided herewith]; Bank of N.Y. Mellon v Gordon , 171 AD3d 197 , 207; Matter of Quast v Westchester County Bd. of Elections , 155 AD3d 674, 675 ). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(3) to dismiss the complaint."
32,"Hua Hafeez, respondent, v TT of Freeport, doing business as BMW of Freeport, appellant.","In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant Yehudit Benyacob appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Larry D. Martin, J.), dated March 29, 2023. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied that defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against her for lack of personal jurisdiction and granted that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve that defendant with the summons and complaint. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. In 2013, the plaintiff commenced this action against, among others, the defendant Yehudit Benyacob (hereinafter the defendant) to foreclose a mortgage. The defendant failed to appear or answer the complaint. On May 4, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment of foreclosure and sale upon the defendant's default. Thereafter, the defendant moved, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR 5015(a)(4) to vacate the judgment of foreclosure and sale, and the plaintiff moved pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the defendant with the summons and complaint. In an order dated November 6, 2019, the court granted that branch of the defendant's motion and the plaintiff's motion. In February 2021, the defendant moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against her for lack of personal jurisdiction, and the plaintiff cross-moved, among other things, again pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the defendant with the summons and complaint. On May 4, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the defendant's motion and the plaintiff's cross-motion. Subsequently, the defendant again moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against her for lack of personal jurisdiction, and the plaintiff again cross-moved, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the defendant with the summons and complaint. In an order dated March 29, 2023, the court, among other things, denied the defendant's motion and granted that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion in the interest of justice. 

The defendant appeals. ""Pursuant to CPLR 306-b, a court may, in its discretion, grant a motion for an extension of the time for service 'upon good cause shown or in the interest of justice'"" ( Pierre v Grueso , 219 AD3d 1535 , 1535, citing Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Boakye-Yiadom , 213 AD3d 976 , 977; see Leader v Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer , 97 NY2d 95, 104 ). ""'Good cause' and 'interest of justice' are two separate and independent statutory standards"" ( BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P. v Rogener , 171 AD3d 996 , 998). ""'The interest of justice standard requires a careful judicial analysis of the factual setting of the case and a balancing of the competing interests presented by the parties. Unlike an extension request premised on good cause, a plaintiff need not establish reasonably diligent efforts at service as a threshold matter'"" ( Pierre v Grueso , 219 AD3d at 1536, quoting Leader v Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer , 97 NY2d at 104 ). ""'In considering the interest of justice standard, the court may consider diligence, or lack thereof, along with any other relevant factor in making its determination, including expiration of the Statute of Limitations, the meritorious nature of the cause of action, the length of delay in service, the promptness of a plaintiff's request for the extension of time, and prejudice to the defendant'"" ( Bhatara v Kolaj , 222 AD3d 926 , 930 [internal quotation marks omitted], quoting Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Fameux , 201 AD3d 1012 , 1014; see Leader v Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer , 97 NY2d at 105-106 ). ""The determination of whether to grant the extension in the interest of justice is within the discretion of the motion court"" ( U.S. Bank N.A. v Bindra , 217 AD3d 719 , 720). Contrary to the defendant's contention, under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in granting that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the defendant with the summons and complaint and properly denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against her for lack of personal jurisdiction ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Ben-Aron , 231 AD3d 1194 ; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Boakye-Yiadom , 213 AD3d 976 , 978). The plaintiff demonstrated that the action was timely commenced, that the statute of limitations had since expired, that there was no identifiable prejudice to the defendant attributable to the delay in service, and that the action is potentially meritorious ( see PNC Bank, N.A. v Sarfaty , 225 AD3d 721 , 723; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Boakye-Yiadom , 213 AD3d at 978). Moreover, notwithstanding the plaintiff's delays in seeking relief pursuant to CPLR 306-b, the record demonstrates that the defendant had actual notice of the action within 120 days of its commencement and served an answer to the complaint in 2020, and that, subsequent to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the plaintiff attempted service at the defendant's residence numerous times, during which the plaintiff's process server was harassed and threatened ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Ben-Aron , 231 AD3d 1194 ; PNC Bank, N.A. v Sarfaty , 225 AD3d at 723). The defendant's remaining contentions are without merit."

ORDERED that the order is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, with costs, and those branches of the petitioner's motion which were for summary judgment on the causes of action seeking relief pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยงยง 273 and 276 and to direct the respondent JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., to turn over the contents of a safe deposit box maintained by the respondents Zakhar Brener and Ninel Krepkina to the extent necessary to satisfy the petitioner's judgment against the respondents Affordable Shoes, Ltd., and Zakhar Brener are granted. In April 2018, the petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 52, seeking, inter alia, the turnover of a safety deposit box maintained by the respondents Zakhar Brener and Ninel Krepkina and of certain residential real property owned by the respondent B and K Trust. The petitioner sought to satisfy a judgment dated November 15, 2017, against the respondent Affordable Shoes, Ltd. (hereinafter Affordable Shoes), and Brener in the total sum of $338,778.72, which was the result of a default by Affordable Shoes on a commercial lease and a default by Brener on an associated personal guaranty. The petition alleged that in January 2014, Brener fraudulently conveyed the real property to B and K Trust, an entity of which Brener and Krepkina, his long-term partner, are cotrustees. The petitioner moved for summary judgment on the petition. Brener, Krepkina, Affordable Shoes, and B and K Trust (hereinafter collectively the Brener respondents) opposed the petitioner's motion. In an order dated April 27, 2020, the Supreme Court, among other things, denied those branches of the petitioner's motion which were for summary judgment on the causes of action seeking relief pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยงยง 273 and 276 and to direct the respondent JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

""Such a proceeding may also be maintained 'against a person who is a transferee of money or other personal property from the judgment debtor'"" ( Matter of Rockefeller v Statement Servs., Corp. , 204 AD3d at 921, quoting CPLR 5225[b]; see Matter of Argyle Funds SPC, Inc. v Barrick , 226 AD3d at 675). ""In order to succeed on a turnover petition, the petitioner must show that the judgment debtor is entitled to the possession of such property or that the judgment creditor's rights to the property are superior to those of the transferee"" ( Matter of Argyle Funds SPC, Inc. v Barrick , 226 AD3d at 675 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see CPLR 5525[b]; Matter of Rockefeller v Statement Servs., Corp. , 204 AD3d at 921). ""A judgment debtor's interest in certain property may be established by showing that the transfer of that property from the judgment debtor to a transferee was fraudulent"" ( Matter of Argyle Funds SPC, Inc. v Barrick , 226 AD3d at 675; see Joslin v Lopez , 309 AD2d 837, 838 ). ""Pursuant to the version of Debtor and Creditor Law ยง 273 applicable at the time of the subject conveyance[ ], a conveyance that renders the conveyor insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to actual intent, if the conveyance was made without fair consideration"" ( Louis Monteleone Fibres, Ltd. v Hudson Baylor Brookhaven, LLC , 228 AD3d 641 , 645; see Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 273 [as added by L 1925, ch 254, ยง 1, repealed by L 2019, ch 580, ยง 2, eff Apr. 4, 2020]; Board of Mgrs. of E. Riv. Tower Condominium v Empire Holdings Group, LLC , 175 AD3d 1377 , 1378). ""To constitute fair consideration, the value given in exchange must be fairly equivalent and proportionate to the value of the property conveyed"" ( Cheek v Brooks , 188 AD3d 785 , 786; see Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 272; Louis Monteleone Fibres, Ltd. v Hudson Baylor Brookhaven, LLC , 228 AD3d at 646). ""Insolvency within the meaning of the Debtor and Creditor Law occurs when 'the present fair salable value of [the debtor's] assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay [the] probable liability on . . . existing debts as they become absolute and matured'"" ( Palmerone v Staples , 195 AD3d 736 , 738, quoting Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 271[1]; see Grace Plaza of Great Neck v Heitzler , 2 AD3d 780, 781 ). ""In general, the burden of proving insolvency is on the party challenging the conveyance.

Here, the petitioner established her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the cause of action seeking relief pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 273 by submitting evidence that Brener was insolvent at the time of the conveyance of the property, which was made without fair consideration ( see Palmerone v Staples , 195 AD3d at 738; Cheek v Brooks , 188 AD3d at 786). In opposition, the Brener respondents failed to raise a triable issue of fact. Furthermore, the petitioner established her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the cause of action seeking relief pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 276. ""Pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยง 276, every conveyance made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors is fraudulent. The requisite intent required by this section need not be proven by direct evidence, but may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the allegedly fraudulent transfer"" ( Louis Monteleone Fibres, Ltd. v Hudson Baylor Brookhaven, LLC , 228 AD3d at 647; see Goldenberg v Friedman , 191 AD3d 641 , 643; Milin v Pak , 189 AD3d 1211 , 1213). ""In determining whether a conveyance was fraudulent, the courts consider the existence of certain common 'badges of fraud,' which include 'a close relationship between the parties to the alleged fraudulent transaction; a questionable transfer not in the usual course of business; inadequacy of the consideration; the transferor's knowledge of the creditor's claim and the inability to pay it; and retention of control of the property by the transferor after the conveyance'"" ( Corning Fed. Credit Union v Georgilis , 217 AD3d 828 , 831, quoting Goldenberg v Friedman , 191 AD3d at 643-644; see Pen Pak Corp. v LaSalle Natl. Bank of Chicago , 240 AD2d 384, 386 ). ""A prime example of this type of fraud is where a debtor transfers his property to another while retaining the use thereof so as to continue . . . free from the claims of creditors"" ( Southern Indus. v Jeremias , 66 AD2d 178, 181 ; see Louis Monteleone Fibres, Ltd. v Hudson Baylor Brookhaven, LLC , 228 AD3d at 647). 

Here, the petitioner submitted, among other things, the Brener respondents' answer, wherein they admitted that Brener continued to occupy and use the property with Krepkina. In opposition, the Brener respondents failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the transfer was in the usual course of business. In addition, the petitioner established her prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the cause of action to direct Chase Bank to turn over of the contents of the safe deposit box maintained by Brener and Krepkina by submitting a letter establishing that Brener and Krepkina jointly held a safe deposit box at one of Chase Bank's branches in Brooklyn ( see Matter of Wells Fargo Vendor Fin. Servs., LLC v JPMorgan Chase Bank , 229 AD3d 794 , 796; Matter of New York Community Bank v Bank of Am., N.A. , 169 AD3d 35 , 39). In opposition, the Brener respondents failed to raise a triable issue of fact. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted those branches of the petitioner's motion which were for summary judgment on the causes of action seeking relief pursuant to Debtor and Creditor Law former ยงยง 273 and 276 and to direct Chase Bank to turn over the contents of the safe deposit box maintained by Brener and Krepkina to the extent necessary to satisfy the petitioner's judgment against Affordable Shoes and Brener."

Fufidio, J.), dated March 30, 2022. The judgment granted the petition, annulled the determination, and, in effect, directed the City Council of the City of Yonkers, NY, to issue the requested special use permit. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed, with costs. The subject property is located in a ""restricted business, residences excluded"" zone, in which a gas station is a permitted use while a convenience store in conjunction with a gas station is a permitted use with a special permit. In March 2018, the petitioner submitted an application for a special use permit to operate a convenience store in conjunction with a gas station on the subject property. After a public hearing, the Planning Board of the City of Yonkers granted the application with certain conditions and referred the matter to the City Council of the City of Yonkers, NY (hereinafter the City Council). After a second public hearing, the City Council, emphasizing the community's objection, denied the application. Thereafter, the petitioner commenced this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 to review the City Council's determination. In a judgment dated March 30, 2022, the Supreme Court granted the petition, annulled the determination, and, in effect, directed the City Council to issue the requested special use permit. The City of Yonkers and the City Council (hereinafter together the appellants) appeal. Contrary to the appellants' contention, the City's Planning Board and Planning Bureau are not necessary parties to this proceeding, as they are not indispensable to the City Council's determination of the petitioner's application ( see CPLR 1001[a]; Matter of TransGas Energy Sys., LLC v New York State Bd. on Elec. Generation Siting & Envt. , 65 AD3d 1247, 1249-1250 ).

""The significance of this distinction is that the 'inclusion of the permitted use in the ordinance is tantamount to a legislative finding that the permitted use is in harmony with the general zoning plan and will not adversely affect the neighborhood'"" ( Matter of Retail Prop. Trust v Board of Zoning Appeals of Town of Hempstead , 98 NY2d 190, 195 , quoting Matter of North Shore Steak House v Board of Appeals of Inc. Vil. of Thomaston , 30 NY2d 238, 243 ). ""Thus, the burden of proof on an applicant seeking a special permit is lighter than that required for a hardship variance"" ( Matter of QuickChek Corp. v Town of Islip , 166 AD3d at 983). ""The approval or denial of an application for a special use permit is an administrative rather than a legislative function and the action of a legislative body in denying such a permit is subject to judicial review under article 78 of the CPLR"" ( Mobil Oil Corp. v City of Syracuse , 52 AD2d 731, 732 ). ""Once an applicant shows 'that the contemplated use is in conformance with the conditions imposed, a special [use] permit or exception must be granted unless there are reasonable grounds for denying it that are supported by substantial evidence'"" ( Matter of Mamaroneck Coastal Envt. Coalition, Inc. v Board of Appeals of the Vil. of Mamaroneck , 152 AD3d 771, 772 , quoting Matter of Leon Petroleum v Board of Trustees of Inc. Vil. of Mineola , 309 AD2d 804, 805 ). ""In reviewing a [city council]'s determination on special [use] permit applications, we are 'limited to determining whether the action taken by the [council] was illegal, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion,' and we 'consider substantial evidence only to determine whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support the rationality of the [council]'s determination'"" ( Matter of QuickChek Corp. v Town of Islip , 166 AD3d at 983, quoting Matter of Beekman Delamater Props., LLC v Village of Rhinebeck Zoning Bd. of Appeals , 150 AD3d 1099, 1103 ). ""'A denial of a special [use] permit must be supported by evidence in the record and may not be based solely upon community objection'"" ( id. at 983-984, quoting Matter of White Castle Sys., Inc. v Board of Zoning Appeals of Town of Hempstead , 93 AD3d 731, 732 ; see Matter of Chestnut Petroleum Dist., Inc. v Town of Mount Pleasant Planning Board , 222 AD3d 748 ). 

Here, the City Council's determination to deny the petitioner's application lacked a rational basis. There was no evidence adduced demonstrating that the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood or community would be detrimentally affected if the application was granted ( see Matter of 666 OCRTT, LLC v Board of Zoning Appeals of the Town of Hempstead , 200 AD3d 682 , 684; Matter of QuickChek Corp. v Town of Islip , 166 AD3d at 984; Matter of Marina's Edge Owner's Corp. v City of New Rochelle Zoning Bd. of Appeals , 129 AD3d 841, 843 ). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the petition, annulled the determination, and, in effect, directed the City Council to issue the requested special use permit. The appellants' remaining contention is without merit."
36,"Deborah Schiffman, etc., appellant, v Affordable Shoes, Ltd., et al., respondents- respondents, et al., respondent.","Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Gregory Carro, J.), rendered January 12, 2022, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of one count of persistent sexual abuse and sentencing him to a determinate term of three years followed by seven years of postrelease supervision, unanimously modified, on the law, to the extent of vacating the sentence and remanding for resentencing, and otherwise affirmed. On December 3, 2021, defendant appeared with counsel and entered a plea of guilty to the felony of persistent sexual abuse in exchange for a sentence of three years of incarceration, to be followed by seven years of postrelease supervision. Defendant admitted that on November 24, 2020, he grabbed the complaining witness and squeezed her buttocks. Defendant confirmed that he was previously convicted of forcible touching in 2015, and again for a separate forcible touching offense in 2016. Following entry of the guilty plea, defendant declined to dispute the predicate felony statement, which alleged that defendant was previously convicted of persistent sexual abuse in 2018. The Department of Probation submitted a presentence report on January 11, 2022, the day prior to sentencing. Defendant alleges that he was never interviewed by the Department and correctly notes that several critical sections of the report are incomplete. For example, the Summary of Defendant's Statement and Evaluative Analysis sections state that defendant's case was reassigned, and the new Investigation officer needs additional time to prepare the report. Further, the Evaluative Analysis section requests an adjournment and a new court order to the Department of Probation so they could obtain the necessary information. The report contains no information about defendant's mental or physical health, the circumstances of his arrest, or the promised sentence. Finally, the report incorrectly lists 2013 as the last time he used controlled substances or alcohol. On January 12, 2022, defendant appeared before the court for sentencing without the presence of his assigned counsel. Upon the court's request, another attorney from the same office appeared virtually on the matter. There is no indication that the substitute attorney had any knowledge of defendant's case or had reviewed the presentence report. When the court informed the substitute attorney of the negotiated sentence, the attorney stated, ""[a]s long as my client agrees that's the promise, I have nothing further."" Prior to imposing sentence, defendant inquired whether the postrelease portion of his sentence would terminate his postrelease sentence from a prior conviction. The court responded equivocally, stating ""I don't believe that terminates that""; and ""I believe so"" when defendant replied, ""[s]o, that's going to be combined with this seven."" In response to this exchange, substitute counsel made no inquiry or statements. The court then imposed the promised sentence with no discussion of the presentence report or a definitive answer to defendant's question concerning the duration of his postrelease supervision. Defendant served his period of incarceration and has since been released. Defendant argues that his sentence was excessive because the presentence report failed to include, and the court failed to consider, defendant's extensive history of personal trauma, substance abuse, and mental health issues, and requests the court to reduce his postrelease supervision to the minimum term of five years. Where a person is convicted of a felony, the court must order a presentence investigation of the defendant and it may not pronounce sentence until it has received a written report of that investigation (CPL 390.20[1]; see People v Selikoff, 35 NY2d 227, 238 [1974], cert denied 419 US 1122 [1975][""the statute mandates, and it is the public policy of this State to require, a presentence report before sentence be imposed""]). The presentence report must be current and contain updated information pertinent to the imposition of a proper sentence ( see People v Laster, 140 AD2d 233, 233 [1st Dept 1988], citing People v Saez, 121 AD2d 947 [1st Dept 1986], affd 69 NY2d 802 [1987][three-and-a-half-year-old presentence report that contained no information regarding the defendant's background, activities in prison, or history following release from prison was inadequate]). We hold that the presentence report in this case was inadequate, as it omitted crucial information regarding defendant's history of trauma, mental health and substance abuse issues and failed to include a victim impact statement, among other things (CPL 390.30). We particularly note that defendant had not been interviewed prior to the report's issuance and that Probation requested an adjournment of sentencing so that the newly assigned case officer could conduct the investigation. Defendant, who was not represented by his assigned counsel at sentencing, did not waive his entitlement to a current, updated report by failing to affirmatively object to the presentence report's sufficiency ( see People v Andujar, 110 AD2d 606, 607-608 [1st Dept 1985] [failure to object to absence of presentence report at sentencing does not constitute waiver]). Because the court pronounced sentence prior to receiving a current and complete presentence report, we vacate the sentence and remand the matter for resentencing in compliance with CPL 390.20(1) ( see People v Saez, 121 AD2d at 948 ). We have considered the remaining arguments and find them unavailing."

38,"C.J., A Child Under Eighteen Years of Age, etc., J.C., Respondent-Appellant, Administration for Children's Services, Petitioner-Respondent. v Muriel Goode-Trufant, Corporation Counsel, New York (Geoffrey E. Curfman of counsel), for respondent.","In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant Fenimore St. Realty, Inc., appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Larry D. Martin, J.), dated April 25, 2023. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied that defendant's cross-motion to reduce the amount of postjudgment interest accrued. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. In 2011, the plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose a mortgage on certain real property located in Brooklyn. In February 2014, while this action was pending, Fenimore St. Realty, Inc. (hereinafter Fenimore), purchased the property. In an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale dated March 28, 2017, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm a referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale and directed the sale of the property. In November 2022, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, to extend the time in which to conduct the foreclosure sale. Fenimore cross-moved to reduce the amount of postjudgment interest accrued. In the order appealed from, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion and denied Fenimore's cross-motion. Fenimore appeals from so much of the order as denied its cross-motion. A foreclosure action is equitable in nature and triggers the equitable powers of the court ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Abakporo , 221 AD3d 939 , 940; Krupnick v Romano , 220 AD3d 941 , 942). In an action of an equitable nature, the recovery of interest is within the court's discretion, and the exercise of that discretion will be governed by the particular facts in each case, including any wrongful conduct by either party ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Abakporo , 221 AD3d at 940; Krupnick v Romano , 220 AD3d at 942; Dayan v York , 51 AD3d 964, 965 ). 

Here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying Fenimore's cross-motion to reduce the interest accrued. Fenimore failed to establish any bad faith or undue delay on the part of the plaintiff that would warrant a reduction in the postjudgment interest ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Abakporo , 221 AD3d at 940)."
39,"853-855 McLean, LLC, respondent, v City of Yonkers, NY, et al., appellants.","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for negligence, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Orange County (David S. Zuckerman, J.), dated June 23, 2023. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, Cornwall Police Department (hereinafter the Police Department) and Town of Cornwall, alleging, inter alia, that their negligence had caused the loss of certain of his personal property. The defendants moved, among other things, pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. In an order dated June 23, 2023, the Supreme Court, inter alia, granted that branch of the defendants' motion. The plaintiff appeals. As a threshold matter, to the extent the plaintiff contends that the Supreme Court erred in denying his motion for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendants, that contention is not properly before this Court, as he did not appeal from the order denying that motion ( see CPLR 5515; J.S. v P.B. , 176 AD3d 790 , 792). Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the Supreme Court properly granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. First, the court properly granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against the Police Department, since departments, such as the Police Department, do not have a legal identity separate and apart from the municipality and, as such, cannot independently be sued ( see Town Law ยง 150[1]; Stevens v Town of E. Fishkill Police Dept. , 198 AD3d 832 , 833). In addition, the court properly granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was to dismiss the cause of action alleging negligence insofar as asserted against the Town. Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, he failed to allege that the Town voluntarily assumed a special duty to him beyond that owed to the general public ( see Maldovan v County of Erie , 39 NY3d 166 , 171; see also Ferreira v City of Binghamton , 38 NY3d 298 , 308-310). To the extent the plaintiff sought relief in the complaint related to the Town's alleged denial of his requests pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law art 6; hereinafter FOIL), and has not abandoned that claim on appeal, the plaintiff failed to allege that he filed a timely appeal to the appropriate authority from the denial of those FOIL requests, as is necessary before seeking recourse in the courts ( see id. ยง 89[4][a]; Matter of Kurland v McLaughlin , 122 AD2d 947, 949 ). To the extent the plaintiff attempts, for the first time on appeal, to characterize the complaint as stating a cause of action pursuant to 18 USC ยง 4 , that statute does not provide for a private cause of action ( see Meinhardt v Escapule , 2016 WL 5393760 , *3, 2016 US Dist LEXIS 132355 , *8 [D Ariz, No. CV-14-02677-PHX-GMS]). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. In light of our determination, we need not reach the defendants' remaining contentions."
40,"The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v Paulino Camacho, Defendant-Appellant.","In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals, and the defendants Seasons at East Meadow Home Owners Association, Inc., and Einsidler Management, Inc., cross-appeal, from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Dawn Jimenez, J.), dated July 25, 2022. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1) insofar as asserted against the defendants Seasons at East Meadow Home Owners Association, Inc., and Einsidler Management, Inc. The order, insofar as cross-appealed from, denied that branch of the motion of the defendants Seasons at East Meadow Home Owners Association, Inc., and Einsidler Management, Inc., which was for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1) insofar as asserted against them. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed and cross-appealed from, without costs or disbursements. The plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries he allegedly sustained on February 11, 2017, while working for his employer, a roofing contractor, at a condominium development owned by the defendant Seasons at East Meadow Home Owners Association, Inc., and managed by the defendant property manager Einsidler Management, Inc. (hereinafter together the defendants). The accident allegedly occurred when the plaintiff fell from the roof of a condominium unit where he had been sent by his employer in response to a complaint by the unit owner of a snow-related ceiling leak. While shoveling snow off of the subject roof, the plaintiff slipped and slid off the roof, causing him to fall approximately 30 feet to the ground. The amended complaint alleged, inter alia, a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1). After the completion of discovery, the defendants moved, among other things, for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1) insofar as asserted against them. The plaintiff moved, inter alia, for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1) insofar as asserted against the defendants. In an order dated July 25, 2022, the Supreme Court, inter alia, denied those branches of the plaintiff's and the defendants' respective motions. The plaintiff appeals and the defendants' cross-appeal. We affirm. ""Labor Law ยง 240(1) imposes upon owners and general contractors, and their agents, a nondelegable duty to provide safety devices necessary to protect workers from risks inherent in elevated work sites"" ( Jarnutowski v City of Long Beach , 210 AD3d 881 , 882 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Londono v Dalen, LLC , 204 AD3d 658 , 659; Majerski v City of New York , 193 AD3d 715 , 716). ""To prevail on a cause of action under Labor Law ยง 240(1), a plaintiff must establish, among other things, that he or she was injured during the erection, demolition, repairing, altering, painting, cleaning or pointing of a building or structure"" ( Stockton v H & E Biffer Enters. No. 2, LLC , 196 AD3d 709 , 710 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Soto v J. Crew Inc. , 21 NY3d 562, 566 ), and that a violation of the statute was a proximate cause of his or her injuries ( see Jarnutowski v City of Long Beach , 210 AD3d at 882). ""Although comparative fault is not a defense to the strict liability of the statute, where the plaintiff is the sole proximate cause of his or her own injuries, there can be no liability under Labor Law ยง 240(1)"" ( Lojano v Soiefer Bros. Realty Corp. , 187 AD3d 1160 , 1162). 

Here, the evidence submitted by the defendants in support of their motion and by the plaintiff in support of his motion failed to eliminate triable issues of fact as to whether the plaintiff was engaged in an enumerated activity within the meaning of Labor Law ยง 240(1) and whether the plaintiff's actions were the sole proximate cause of his injuries ( see Rzepka v City of New York , 227 AD3d 922 ; Jin Kil Kim v Franklin BH, LLC , 214 AD3d 857 , 859; Castano v Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC , 213 AD3d 905 , 908; Jarnutowski v City of Long Beach , 210 AD3d at 882). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied that branch of the defendants' motion which was for summary judgment dismissing the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1) insofar as asserted against them, and properly denied that branch of the plaintiff's motion which was for summary judgment on the issue of liability on that cause of action insofar as asserted against the defendants."
41,"The People of the State of New York, plaintiff, v Osvaldo Garcia, defendant.","In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for false imprisonment and medical malpractice, the defendants appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Rockland County (Thomas P. Zugibe, J.), dated November 15, 2021. The order, after a hearing to determine the validity of service of process upon the defendant Mark Scher, in effect, granted the plaintiff's motion pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve that defendant with the summons and complaint and, in effect, denied, as academic, that branch of the defendants' cross-motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendant Mark Scher for lack of personal jurisdiction. 

ORDERED that the appeal by the defendants Amanda F. Banks and Montefiore Nyack Hospital from so much of the order as, in effect, granted the plaintiff's motion pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the defendant Mark Scher with the summons and complaint is dismissed, as those defendants are not aggrieved by that portion of the order ( see CPLR 5511); and it is further, 

ORDERED that the order is reversed on the appeal by the defendant Mark Scher and insofar as reviewed on the appeal by the defendants Amanda F. Banks and Montefiore Nyack Hospital, on the facts and in the exercise of discretion, the plaintiff's motion pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve the defendant Mark Scher with the summons and complaint is denied, and that branch of the defendants' cross-motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendant Mark Scher for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted; and it is further, 

ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the defendants. On June 10, 2020, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, inter alia, to recover damages for false imprisonment and medical malpractice. The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the defendant Mark Scher, a psychiatrist, wrongfully caused her to be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric unit of the defendant Montefiore Nyack Hospital. In April 2021, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, for leave to enter a default judgment against Scher, who failed to interpose an answer. The defendants cross-moved, among other things, pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against Scher, contending that he had not been properly served with the summons and complaint. In an order dated July 15, 2021, the Supreme Court, inter alia, denied that branch of the plaintiff's motion and directed a hearing to determine the validity of service of process upon Scher. On Saturday, September 25, 2021, the plaintiff moved pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve Scher with the summons and complaint. On September 28, 2021, the hearing to determine the validity of service of process upon Scher was held. By order dated November 15, 2021, the Supreme Court, in effect, granted the plaintiff's motion and extended the time to effectuate service upon Scher to 30 days from the date of the order. In addition, the court, which found that Scher had not been properly served with the summons and complaint, in effect, denied, as academic, that branch of the defendants' cross-motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against Scher for lack of personal jurisdiction. This appeal ensued. Pursuant to CPLR 306-b, a plaintiff is required to serve the summons and complaint within 120 days after commencement of the action. If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon the defendant within that time, ""the court, upon motion, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant, or upon good cause shown or in the interest of justice, extend the time for service"" ( id. ; see Quinones v Z & B Trucking, Inc. , 220 AD3d 903 ). ""To establish good cause, a plaintiff must demonstrate reasonable diligence in attempting service"" ( Bumpus v New York City Tr. Auth. , 66 AD3d 26 , 31; see Leader v Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer , 97 NY2d 95, 105-106 ). Such a showing is not required to obtain an extension of time under the interest of justice standard, which is a broader standard intended to ""'accommodate late service that might be due to mistake, confusion or oversight, so long as there is no prejudice to the defendant'"" ( Leader v Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer , 97 NY2d at 105 , quoting NY St Bar Assn Comm on Civ Prac Law & Rules, Legis Rep, Bill Jacket, L 1997, ch 476 at 14; see Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Wilson , 176 AD3d 1087 , 1089). ""The interest of justice standard requires a careful judicial analysis of the factual setting of the case and a balancing of the competing interests presented by the parties"" ( Leader v Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer , 97 NY2d at 105 ; see Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Wilson , 176 AD3d at 1089). In reaching its determination, ""the court may consider diligence, or lack thereof, along with any other relevant factor in making its determination, including expiration of the Statute of Limitations, the meritorious nature of the cause of action, the length of delay in service, the promptness of a plaintiff's request for the extension of time, and prejudice to defendant"" ( Leader v Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer , 97 NY2d at 105-106 ; see Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Wilson , 176 AD3d at 1089). 

Here, the plaintiff failed to establish good cause to extend the time to serve Scher, as no evidence was offered that she attempted to serve him with reasonable diligence. Further, contrary to the Supreme Court's determination, the plaintiff failed to establish that an extension of time to serve Scher was warranted in the interest of justice. The plaintiff failed to offer any explanation for the eight-month delay in filing the affidavit of service, the delay in moving, among other things, for leave to enter a default judgment against Scher, and the four-month delay in moving to extend the time to serve Scher after the defendants had cross-moved, inter alia, to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against Scher for lack of personal jurisdiction. There is no evidence in the record that Scher had notice of the action during the 120-day period after the commencement of the action ( see HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Lev , 181 AD3d 938 , 941). While the expiration of the statute of limitations by the time the plaintiff moved to extend the time to serve Scher is a factor that weighs in the plaintiff's favor, that factor was outweighed by other factors, most notably, the plaintiff's overall lack of diligence ( see US Bank N.A. v Fink , 206 AD3d 858 , 861; HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Lev , 181 AD3d at 941; Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Wilson , 176 AD3d at 1089). The Supreme Court, therefore, should have denied the plaintiff's motion pursuant to CPLR 306-b to extend the time to serve Scher with the summons and complaint and granted that branch of the defendants' cross-motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against Scher for lack of personal jurisdiction ( see US Bank N.A. v Fink , 206 AD3d at 861; Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Wilson , 176 AD3d at 1090)."
42,"Bank of New York Mellon, etc., respondent, v Fenimore St. Realty, Inc., appellant, et al., defendants.","In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant Salvatore Pane appeals from an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale (one paper) of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (S. Betsy Heckman Torres, J.), entered March 28, 2023. The order and judgment of foreclosure and sale, upon an order of the same court dated January 23, 2023, inter alia, granting the plaintiff's motion to confirm a referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale and denying that defendant's cross-motion pursuant to CPLR 3215(c) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him as abandoned, among other things, granted the same relief to the plaintiff and directed the sale of the subject property. 

ORDERED that the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale is affirmed, with costs. In November 2011, the plaintiff commenced this action against, among others, Salvatore Pane (hereinafter the defendant) to foreclose a mortgage on certain residential property located in Lindenhurst. The defendant failed to timely answer the complaint. On May 2, 2012, the plaintiff filed a request for judicial intervention (hereinafter RJI) seeking a residential mortgage foreclosure settlement conference. A foreclosure settlement conference was held on July 10, 2012, at which the defendant failed to appear, and the action was released from the foreclosure settlement part on the same day. On May 21, 2013, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant and for an order of reference. In an order dated February 25, 2014, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion and referred the matter to a referee to ascertain and compute the amount due to the plaintiff. In August 2019, the plaintiff moved to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. The defendant cross-moved pursuant to CPLR 3215(c) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him as abandoned. In an order dated January 23, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion and denied the defendant's cross-motion. On March 28, 2023, the court entered an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale, among other things, directing the sale of the subject property. 

The defendant appeals. CPLR 3215(c) provides that ""[i]f the plaintiff fails to take proceedings for the entry of judgment within one year after [a defendant's] default, the court shall not enter judgment but shall dismiss the complaint as abandoned . . . unless sufficient cause is shown why the complaint should not be dismissed."" ""'The language of CPLR 3215(c) is not, in the first instance, discretionary, but mandatory, inasmuch as courts ""shall"" dismiss claims (CPLR 3215[c]) for which default judgments are not sought within the requisite one-year period, as those claims are then deemed abandoned'"" ( Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v O'Connor , 223 AD3d 872 , 874, quoting Giglio v NTIMP, Inc. , 86 AD3d 301, 307-308 ). ""To establish sufficient cause, the plaintiff must 'proffer a reasonable excuse for the delay in timely moving for a default judgment and . . . demonstrate that the cause of action is potentially meritorious'"" ( id. , quoting HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Grella , 145 AD3d 669, 671 ). Where an action is subject to a mandatory settlement conference ( see CPLR 3408), motions shall be held in abeyance while conferences are held and the one-year deadline imposed by CPLR 3215(c) is tolled ( see 22 NYCRR 202.12-a[c][7]; Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v O'Connor , 223 AD3d at 874). 

Here, the defendant was personally served with process on February 22, 2012, and thus, had 20 days, or until March 13, 2012, to answer or otherwise appear in the action ( see CPLR 320[a]; 3012[a]). The defendant failed to do so, and therefore, was in default as of March 14, 2012. Thus, the plaintiff had one year from March 14, 2012, to take proceedings for the entry of a default judgment ( see id. ยง 3215[c]). The plaintiff did not take such proceedings until approximately 14 months later, when it moved, inter alia, for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant and an order of reference in May 2013. Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the one-year deadline pursuant to CPLR 3215(c) was not tolled for the period of approximately two months after the RJI was filed on May 2, 2012, and before the action was released from the foreclosure settlement part on July 10, 2012. Pursuant to CPLR 3408(a), mandatory settlement conferences must be held ""in any residential foreclosure action involving a home loan as such term is defined in [RPAPL 1304], in which the defendant is a resident of the property subject to foreclosure "" (CPLR 3408[a][1] [emphasis added]; see 22 NYCRR ยง 202.12-a[a]; Bank of N.Y. Mellon v Lee , 201 AD3d 852 , 853; Richlew Real Estate Venture v Grant , 131 AD3d 1223, 1224 ). 

Here, the record reflects that the defendant was not a resident of the subject property at the time this action was commenced, and therefore, that the action was not subject to mandatory settlement conferences ( see HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Seidner , 159 AD3d 1035 , 1036). Thus, the plaintiff's time to move for leave to enter a default judgment was not tolled while the matter was in the foreclosure settlement conference part ( see id. ). Further, ""where . . . a settlement conference is a necessary prerequisite to obtaining a default judgment,"" the filing of an RJI seeking a mandatory foreclosure settlement conference constitutes the taking of proceedings for the entry of judgment pursuant to CPLR 3215(c) ( Citimortgage, Inc. v Zaibak , 188 AD3d 982 , 983; see U.S. Bank N.A. v Jerriho-Cadogan , 224 AD3d 788 , 790). 

Here, however, since the action was not subject to mandatory foreclosure settlement conferences ( see HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Seidner , 159 AD3d 1035 , 1036), a settlement conference was not ""a necessary prerequisite to obtaining a default judgment"" ( Citimortgage, Inc. v Zaibak , 188 AD3d at 983), and therefore, the plaintiff's filing of the RJI did not constitute the taking of proceedings for the entry of judgment within the meaning of CPLR 3215(c). Nevertheless, under the particular circumstances of this case, the plaintiff demonstrated a reasonable excuse for failing to timely move for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant based upon its reasonable belief that the action was subject to mandatory foreclosure settlement conferences ( see U.S. Bank N.A. v 63 Holiday Drive Realty Corp. , 230 AD3d 713 , 714). Moreover, the plaintiff demonstrated a potentially meritorious cause of action. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale and denied the defendant's cross-motion pursuant to CPLR 3215(c) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against him as abandoned. The defendant's remaining contentions are without merit."
43,"Michael H. Winter, appellant v Cornwall Police Department, et al., respondents.","Appeal by the defendant from an order of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Jerry M. Iannece, J.), dated June 7, 2023, which, after a hearing, designated him a level two sex offender pursuant to Correction Law article 6-C. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs or disbursements. In this proceeding pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law art 6-C; hereinafter SORA), the Supreme Court assessed the defendant 105 points on the risk assessment instrument, rendering him a presumptive level two sex offender, and denied his application for a downward departure from his presumptive risk level. 

The defendant appeals. Contrary to the defendant's contention, the Supreme Court properly assessed 15 points under risk factor 11, as the People established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offense and had a history of substance abuse ( see People v Velasco-Morales , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01655 ; People v Coleman , 225 AD3d 792 ). The defendant's contention that the Supreme Court improperly assessed 10 points under risk factor 15 is unpreserved for appellate review, as he failed to raise this contention at the SORA hearing ( see CPL 470.05[2]; People v Melendez , 210 AD3d 1121 , 1122; People v Bethel , 165 AD3d 712 , 713). In any event, this contention is without merit. A defendant seeking a downward departure from the presumptive risk level has the initial burden of ""(1) identifying, as a matter of law, an appropriate mitigating factor, namely, a factor which tends to establish a lower likelihood of reoffense or danger to the community and is of a kind, or to a degree, that is otherwise not adequately taken into account by the Guidelines; and (2) establishing the facts in support of its existence by a preponderance of the evidence"" ( People v Wyatt , 89 AD3d 112, 128 ; see Sex Offender Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 4 [2006] [hereinafter Guidelines]; People v Gillotti , 23 NY3d 841, 861 ). ""If the defendant makes that twofold showing, the court must exercise its discretion by weighing the mitigating factor to determine whether the totality of the circumstances warrants a departure to avoid an overassessment of the defendant's dangerousness and risk of sexual recidivism"" ( People v Alvarado , 173 AD3d 909 , 910; see People v Gillotti , 23 NY3d at 861 ; People v Felton , 175 AD3d 734, 735; People v Champagne , 140 AD3d 719, 720 ). 

Here, the defendant failed to demonstrate that a downward departure was warranted. While a ""'defendant's response to [sex offender] treatment may qualify as a ground for a downward departure where the response is exceptional'"" ( People v Del-Carmen , 186 AD3d 878 , 879, quoting People v Wallace , 144 AD3d 775, 776 ), the defendant failed to establish that his response to such treatment was exceptional ( see People v Wanzer , 218 AD3d 805 , 806; People v Leung , 191 AD3d 1023 , 1024). The other alleged mitigating factors identified by the defendant, namely that his family was supportive of him and that he accepted responsibility for his crime, were adequately taken into account by the Guidelines ( see People v Taylor , 199 AD3d 845 , 846; People v Garcia , 192 AD3d 833 , 834; People v Robinson , 179 AD3d 1104 , 1105). 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly designated the defendant a level two sex offender."
44,"Edwin Delcid-Funez, appellant-respondent, v Seasons at East Meadow Home Owners Association, Inc., et al., respondents-appellants, et al., defendant.","In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant Fenimore St. Realty, Inc., appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Larry D. Martin, J.), dated April 25, 2023. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied that defendant's cross-motion to reduce the amount of postjudgment interest accrued. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. In 2011, the plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose a mortgage on certain real property located in Brooklyn. In February 2014, while this action was pending, Fenimore St. Realty, Inc. (hereinafter Fenimore), purchased the property. In an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale dated March 28, 2017, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm a referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale and directed the sale of the property. In November 2022, the plaintiff moved, inter alia, to extend the time in which to conduct the foreclosure sale. Fenimore cross-moved to reduce the amount of postjudgment interest accrued. In the order appealed from, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion and denied Fenimore's cross-motion. Fenimore appeals from so much of the order as denied its cross-motion. A foreclosure action is equitable in nature and triggers the equitable powers of the court ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Abakporo , 221 AD3d 939 , 940; Krupnick v Romano , 220 AD3d 941 , 942). In an action of an equitable nature, the recovery of interest is within the court's discretion, and the exercise of that discretion will be governed by the particular facts in each case, including any wrongful conduct by either party ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Abakporo , 221 AD3d at 940; Krupnick v Romano , 220 AD3d at 942; Dayan v York , 51 AD3d 964, 965 ). 

Here, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying Fenimore's cross-motion to reduce the interest accrued. Fenimore failed to establish any bad faith or undue delay on the part of the plaintiff that would warrant a reduction in the postjudgment interest ( see Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Abakporo , 221 AD3d at 940)."
45,"Stacey Druss, respondent, v Mark Scher, et al., appellants.","In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (Lewis J. Lubell, J.), dated August 16, 2022. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint and denied that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was for leave to serve a late notice of claim. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. In August 2020, the plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries when she slipped and fell on wet carpet at the premises of the defendant, Westchester Medical Center (hereinafter WMC). On October 16, 2020, the plaintiff sent a letter (hereinafter the October 2020 letter) notifying WMC of her fall and her intention to commence an action to recover damages for personal injuries. The October 2020 letter stated, inter alia, the date and the address where the accident occurred. However, the October 2020 letter did not describe the exact location within WMC's premises where the accident occurred. On March 4, 2022, the plaintiff commenced this action against WMC. WMC moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) and (7) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred and for failure to state a cause of action. The plaintiff cross-moved, inter alia, for leave to serve a late notice of claim. In an order dated August 16, 2022, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted WMC's motion and denied that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion. The plaintiff appeals. General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(1)(a) requires a plaintiff to serve a notice of claim within 90 days after a claim arises as a condition precedent to commencement of a tort action against a municipal corporation. ""'[I]n determining compliance with the requirements of General Municipal Law ยง 50-e, courts should focus on the purpose served by a Notice of Claim: whether based on the claimant's description municipal authorities can locate the place, fix the time and understand the nature of the accident'"" ( T.N. v City of New York , 227 AD3d 815 , 816, quoting Brown v City of New York , 95 NY2d 389, 393 ; see Behrens v Town of Huntington , 230 AD3d 730 , 731-732). 

Here, the plaintiff contends that the October 2020 letter served as a valid notice of claim. However, the October 2020 letter failed to comply with the specificity requirements of General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(2), as it, inter alia, failed to describe the location of the plaintiff's accident with sufficient specificity, and thus, the October 2020 letter was insufficient to serve as a valid notice of claim ( see Behrens v Town of Huntington , 230 AD3d at 732). Furthermore, even taking into account Executive Order (A. Cuomo) No. 202.8 (9 NYCRR 8.202.8), which tolled certain statutes of limitation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic through November 4, 2020, the plaintiff only had 90 days after the toll was lifted, or until February 2, 2021, to serve a notice of claim, and she failed to do so. Therefore, the plaintiff failed to comply with the condition precedent of General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(1), as she failed to timely serve a notice of claim. ""In determining whether to grant a petition for leave to serve a late notice of claim or to deem a late notice of claim timely served nunc pro tunc, a court must consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, whether the municipality acquired actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim within 90 days after the claim arose or a reasonable time thereafter, whether the delay would substantially prejudice the municipality in its defense, and whether the petitioner demonstrated a reasonable excuse for the failure to serve a timely notice of claim"" ( Matter of Ionescu v City of New York , 230 AD3d 1143 , 1144; see General Municipal Law ยง 50-e[5]; Matter of Cleary v Nassau Health Care Corp. , 215 AD3d 958 , 959; Matter of Ibrahim v New York City Tr. Auth. , 202 AD3d 786 , 787). ""Neither the presence nor absence of any one factor is determinative, although it is generally recognized that the question of whether the municipality timely acquired actual knowledge is of great importance"" ( Matter of C.N. v City of New York , 208 AD3d 784 , 785; see I.N. v City of Yonkers , 203 AD3d 721 , 723). 

Here, the plaintiff failed to establish that WMC had actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim, failed to provide a reasonable excuse, and failed to establish that it would not substantially prejudice WMC in its defense if the late notice were allowed. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was for leave to serve a late notice of claim. Moreover, even assuming that the plaintiff satisfied General Municipal Law ยง 50-e(5), she then had one year and 90 days after the toll on the statute of limitations was lifted, or until February 2, 2022, to commence this action but did not do so until March 4, 2022, 30 days after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. Therefore, the Supreme Court properly granted WMC's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was time-barred. The plaintiff's remaining contentions are improperly raised for the first time on appeal."
46,"JDM Washington Street LLC, Plaintiff-Appellant, v 90 Washington Street, LLC, et al., Defendants-Respondents.","In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals, and the defendant Limonejo's Framing Corp. cross-appeals, from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Joseph A. Santorelli, J.), dated April 17, 2023. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1) insofar as asserted against the defendant Limonejo's Framing Corp. The order, insofar as cross-appealed from, denied the cross-motion of the defendant Limonejo's Framing Corp. for summary judgment on its second and seventh affirmative defenses. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed and cross-appealed from, without costs or disbursements. On January 4, 2019, the plaintiff allegedly was injured when he fell from the roof of a building while checking to make sure a tarp was properly placed and a gust of wind raised the tarp, which ""threw"" him from the roof. The plaintiff's company, JWS Construction and Remodeling Corp., had been hired by the defendant Limonejo's Framing Corp. (hereinafter the defendant) to perform work on the building as part of an extension and remodeling project. In October 2019, the plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries against, among others, the defendant. Thereafter, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1) insofar as asserted against the defendant. The defendant cross-moved for summary judgment on its second and seventh affirmative defenses, alleging, respectively, that the plaintiff was the sole proximate cause of the accident and was a recalcitrant worker. In an order dated April 17, 2023, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's motion and the defendant's cross-motion. The plaintiff appeals and the defendant cross-appeals. ""Labor Law ยง 240(1) imposes upon owners and general contractors, and their agents, a nondelegable duty to provide safety devices necessary to protect workers from risks inherent in elevated work sites"" ( Guaman v 178 Ct. St., LLC , 200 AD3d 655 , 657; see McCarthy v Turner Constr., Inc. , 17 NY3d 369, 374 ). ""To prevail on a Labor Law ยง 240(1) cause of action, 'a plaintiff must prove that the defendant violated the statute and that such violation was a proximate cause of his or her injuries'"" ( Hossain v Condominium Bd. of Grand Professional Bldg. , 221 AD3d 981 , 983, quoting Exley v Cassell Vacation Homes, Inc. , 209 AD3d 839 , 840). 

Here, the plaintiff's submissions in support of his motion, including a transcript of his deposition testimony, failed to eliminate triable issues of fact as to whether adequate safety devices were provided to him at the work site and, if not, whether the absence of adequate safety devices was a proximate cause of the accident ( see Lewis v Lester's of N.Y., Inc. , 205 AD3d 796 , 798; Guaman v 178 Ct. St., LLC , 200 AD3d at 657). Since the plaintiff failed to establish his prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability on the cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law ยง 240(1), the Supreme Court properly denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on that cause of action insofar as asserted against the defendant, without regard to the sufficiency of the opposition papers ( see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr. , 64 NY2d 851, 853 ). ""[W]here the plaintiff is the sole proximate cause of his or her own injuries, there can be no liability under Labor Law ยง 240(1)"" ( Lojano v Soiefer Bros. Realty Corp. , 187 AD3d 1160 , 1162; see Chiarella v New York State Thruway Auth. , 230 AD3d 463 , 465). ""To establish, prima facie, that a plaintiff was the sole proximate cause of an accident, a defendant has to establish that the plaintiff misused an otherwise proper safety device, chose to use an inadequate safety device when proper devices were readily available, or failed to use any device when proper devices were available"" ( Lochan v H & H Sons Home Improvement, Inc. , 216 AD3d 630 , 633). ""'Generally, the issue of whether a particular safety device provided proper protection is a question of fact for the jury'"" ( Welsch v Maimonides Med. Ctr. , 80 AD3d 755, 756 , quoting Delahaye v Saint Anns School , 40 AD3d 679, 682 ). 

Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff ( see Jean-Joseph v Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J. , 211 AD3d 717 , 718), the defendant failed to eliminate triable issues of fact as to whether adequate safety devices were readily available to the plaintiff ( see Lochan v H & H Sons Home Improvement, Inc. , 216 AD3d at 633; Welsch v Maimonides Med. Ctr. , 80 AD3d at 756 ). Moreover, the defendant failed to demonstrate, prima facie, that the plaintiff was specifically instructed to use ropes while working on the roof and disregarded those instructions ( see Gurung v Arnav Retirement Trust , 79 AD3d 969, 970 ; Santo v Scro , 43 AD3d 897, 898-899 ). Thus, the defendant failed to establish, prima facie, that the plaintiff was the sole proximate cause of the accident or was a recalcitrant worker. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment on its second and seventh affirmative defenses, without regard to the sufficiency of the opposition papers ( see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr. , 64 NY2d at 853 ). The plaintiff's remaining contention is improperly raised for the first time on appeal and, thus, is not properly before this Court."
47,"U.S. Bank National Association, etc., Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent, v DLJ Mortgage Capital, Inc., et al., Defendants-Respondents-Appellants.","In related proceedings pursuant to Social Services Law ยง 384-b, the mother appeals, and the father separately appeals, from four orders of fact-finding and disposition of the Family Court, Queens County (Connie Gonzalez, J.) (one as to each child), all dated April 30, 2024. The orders of fact-finding and disposition, after fact-finding and dispositional hearings, found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the subject children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the subject children to the petitioner and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption. 

ORDERED that the orders of fact-finding and disposition are affirmed, without costs or disbursements. The petitioner, MercyFirst (hereinafter the agency), commenced these proceedings to terminate the parental rights of the mother and the father to the subject children on the ground of permanent neglect. Following fact-finding and dispositional hearings, the Family Court found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the children to the agency and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption. The mother and the father separately appeal. ""When a foster care agency brings a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the ground of permanent neglect, it must, as a threshold matter, prove by clear and convincing evidence that it has fulfilled its statutory duty to exercise diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parent-child relationship"" ( Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d 732 , 733 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Naijah-S.G.B. [Thomas X.B.] , 230 AD3d 1314 , 1314). ""Those efforts must include counseling, making suitable arrangements for parental access, providing assistance to the parents to resolve the problems preventing the child's discharge, and advising the parents of the child's progress and development"" ( Matter of Christopher C. [Sonia C.] , 235 AD3d 865 , 856 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 733). Once the agency demonstrates that it made diligent efforts to strengthen the parental relationship, it bears the burden of proving ""by clear and convincing evidence, that for a period of one year following the child's placement with the agency, the parent failed to maintain contact with the child or, alternatively, failed to plan for the future of the child, although physically and financially able to do so"" ( Matter of Daniel J.L. [Sayid L.] , 213 AD3d 939 , 940; see Social Services Law ยง 384-b[7][a]). ""A parent who has only partially complied with his or her service plan and who has not gained insight into the issues that caused the removal of the child has not planned for the child's future"" ( Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 733). 

Here, the agency met its burden of establishing that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children. The agency demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that it made diligent efforts to strengthen each parent's relationship with the children by formulating a service plan that served each parent's needs, providing referrals to programs, explaining the importance of compliance with the service plan, and facilitating parental access between the parents and the children. Moreover, the record shows that the parents failed to plan for the children's futures, despite the agency's diligent efforts, as they only partially complied with their service plans ( see Matter of Damaris E.A. [Johanna A.M.] , 217 AD3d 860 , 861; Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 734). 

Accordingly, the Family Court properly found that the parents permanently neglected the children. The evidence adduced at the dispositional hearing established that termination of the parental rights of the mother and the father was in the best interests of the children ( see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d 913 , 914; Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d 730 , 731). Contrary to the mother's contention, a suspended judgment would not be in the children's best interests, as such a disposition would ""only prolong the delay of stability and permanenc[y]"" in the children's lives ( Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d at 732; see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d at 914-915). Further, the record supports the Family Court's determination that the children's best interests would be served by freeing them for adoption by their respective foster parents, with whom each child has bonded and resided with over a prolonged period of time ( see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d at 915; Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d at 732)."

Lopresto, J.), rendered January 9, 2020, convicting him of rape in the first degree, sexual abuse in the first degree, rape in the third degree, and criminal contempt in the second degree (two counts), upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. Contrary to the defendant's contention, the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence. ""Weight of the evidence review requires a court first to determine whether an acquittal would not have been unreasonable"" ( People v Ford , 233 AD3d 891 , 893 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Abellard , 189 AD3d 1605 , 1606). An acquittal would not have been unreasonable 

here, so this Court ""must weigh conflicting testimony, review any rational inferences that may be drawn from the evidence and evaluate the strength of such conclusions"" ( People v Branch , 186 AD3d 1705 , 1706 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""Based on the weight of the credible evidence, the court then decides whether the jury was justified in finding the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"" ( People v Abellard , 189 AD3d at 1606 [internal quotation marks omitted]). However, ""[g]reat deference is accorded to the jury's opportunity to view the witnesses, hear the testimony, and observe demeanor"" ( People v Ford , 233 AD3d at 893; see People v Ruiz , 228 AD3d 785 , 785). Upon reviewing the record 

here, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence ( see People v Perez , 168 AD3d 988 , 988). Contrary to the defendant's contention, he was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel under the New York Constitution, since, viewing defense counsel's performance in its totality, counsel provided meaningful representation ( see People v Debillis , 40 NY3d 431 , 436). Further, the defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel under the United States Constitution ( see Strickland v Washington , 466 US 668 ). The defendant's contention that the Supreme Court erred in allowing the People to confer with a witness during trial is unpreserved for appellate review ( see People v Larregui , 164 AD3d 1622 , 1624) and, in any event, without merit ( see People v Branch , 83 NY2d 663, 667 ; Matter of Isaiah D. , 127 AD3d 1184, 1185 ). 

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment."
49,"Sonja Brown-Clarke, Plaintiff-Respondent, v The City of New York, Defendant, Riverbay Corporation, Defendant-Appellant.","In a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 4, the father appeals from an order of the Family Court, Suffolk County (Alfred C. Graf, J.), dated April 2, 2024. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied the father's objections to so much of an order of the same court (Darlene Jorif-Mangane, S.M.) dated January 16, 2024, as directed, after a hearing, and upon findings of fact dated January 12, 2024, that a judgment be entered in favor of the mother and against the father in the sum of $56,636.16 for child care arrears. 

ORDERED that the order dated April 2, 2024, is affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements. The parties have two children together, born in 2004 and 2006. A separation agreement, which was incorporated but not merged into the parties' judgment of divorce, among other things, required the father to pay $589.96 per month to the mother for his pro rata share of child care expenses. In July 2023, the mother filed a petition alleging, inter alia, that the father had failed to make the required child care payments. After a hearing, the Support Magistrate, in an order dated January 16, 2024, among other things, directed that a judgment be entered in favor of the mother and against the father in the sum of $56,636.16 for child care arrears, upon finding that the father failed to make any child care payments from October 2009 through September 2017. In February 2024, the father filed objections, inter alia, to that portion of the Support Magistrate's order. In an order dated April 2, 2024, the Family Court, among other things, denied those objections. The father appeals. ""The settlement agreement is a contract subject to principles of contract interpretation"" ( Rainbow v Swisher , 72 NY2d 106, 109 ; see Cervera v Cervera , 218 AD3d 636 , 638). ""If not merged, the agreement may survive as a basis for suit, independent of other available procedures for enforcing the decree"" ( Rainbow v Swisher , 72 NY2d at 109 ). ""Where . . . the contract is clear and unambiguous on its face, the intent of the parties must be gleaned from within the four corners of the instrument, and not from extrinsic evidence"" ( id. ). Therefore, the court should construe the agreement in such a way as to ""give fair meaning to all of the language employed by the parties to reach a practical interpretation of the expressions of the parties so that their reasonable expectations will be realized"" ( Rhoda v Rhoda , 175 AD3d 1572 , 1573). ""Whether an agreement is ambiguous is a question of law for the courts"" ( Matter of Louie v Plissner , 174 AD3d 607 , 609). The Family Court correctly determined that the father was obligated to pay monthly child care expenses to the mother as stipulated under the terms of the settlement agreement. Further, contrary to the father's contention, the language of the agreement did not include a requirement that the mother provide evidence of child care expenses."

Brown, J.), rendered May 16, 2023, convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence. The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. The defendant was arrested after a stop and frisk resulting in the recovery of a firearm. After a hearing, the County Court denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress the physical evidence recovered, including the firearm, and the defendant's statements made to law enforcement officials. After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. 

The defendant appeals. Pursuant to People v De Bour ( 40 NY2d 210 ), there is ""a graduated four-level test for evaluating the propriety of police encounters when a police officer is acting in a law enforcement capacity"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d 869 , 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ). ""The first level permits a police officer to request information from an individual, and merely requires that the request be supported by an objective, credible reason, not necessarily indicative of criminality"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""The second level, known as the common-law right of inquiry, requires a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, and permits a somewhat greater intrusion"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""Based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, the subject may be asked to produce identification, may be asked whether he [or she] has weapons, and may be asked to remove his [or her] hands from his [or her] pockets"" ( Matter of Shakir J. , 119 AD3d 792, 794-795 [citation omitted]; see People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ; People v Muhammed , 196 AD3d 1151 , 1152-1153). ""The third level permits a police officer to forcibly stop and detain an individual"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""Such a detention, however, is not permitted unless there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime"" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). ""A corollary of the statutory right to temporarily detain for questioning is the authority to frisk if the officer reasonably suspects that he [or she] is in danger of physical injury by virtue of the detainee being armed"" ( People v De Bour , 40 NY2d at 223 ). ""The fourth level authorizes an arrest based on probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime"" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

Here, in light of the evidence demonstrating that the defendant matched the general description of the perpetrator, who had brandished a firearm, that was broadcast over the police radio, along with the defendant's temporal and spatial proximity to the scene of that incident, and the officers' observations that the defendant put his hands in his waistband, the police had reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the defendant ( see People v De Bour , 40 NY2d at 223 ; People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ; People v Richardson , 219 AD3d 637 , 638; People v Maschoun , 186 AD3d 1402 , 1403; People v Currie , 131 AD3d 1265 ; People v Abdul-Mateen , 126 AD3d 986, 988 ). To the extent that 

the defendant contends that introducing his statements made to law enforcement officials violated his Miranda rights ( see Miranda v Arizona , 384 US 436 ), the evidence at the hearing established that the statements were made spontaneously and were not the product of police interrogation or its functional equivalent ( see People v Martinez , 186 AD3d 1530 , 1531; People v Barnes , 171 AD3d 1082 , 1082). 

Accordingly, the County Court properly denied those branches of the defendant's omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement officials. The defendant's contention that Penal Law ยง 265.03 is unconstitutional in light of the decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v Bruen ( 597 US 1 ) is unpreserved for appellate review, as the defendant failed to raise a constitutional challenge before the County Court ( see People v Robb , 233 AD3d 805 ; People v Bynum , 225 AD3d 781 , 781; People v Chase , 223 AD3d 913 , 913). In any event, the Bruen decision ""had no impact on the constitutionality of New York State's criminal possession of a weapon statutes"" ( People v Manners , 217 AD3d 683 , 686; see People v Sargeant , 230 AD3d 1341 , 1355; People v Chase , 223 AD3d at 913). The defendant's contention that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel is without merit. Under both the state and federal standards for ineffective assistance of counsel, ""[t]here can be no denial of effective assistance . . . arising from counsel's failure to make a motion or argument that has little or no chance of success"" ( People v Caban , 5 NY3d 143, 152 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Parvez , 209 AD3d 885 , 887; People v Clark , 171 AD3d 942 , 944; see also People v Kamara , 234 AD3d 496 , 497). The defendant's remaining contention is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, without merit."

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. The defendant's contention that an order of protection issued at the time of sentencing should be vacated because the Supreme Court failed to state on the record the reasons for issuing it ( see CPL 530.12[5]) is unpreserved for appellate review, since the defendant failed to object to the order of protection at sentencing or otherwise raise the issue before the court ( see id. ยง 470.05[2]; People v Newman , 234 AD3d 877 ; People v Daniel , 233 AD3d 704 ; People v Demilio , 227 AD3d 1098 , 1100-1101). Under the circumstances presented, we decline to review that contention in the exercise of our interest of justice jurisdiction ( see People v Crosby , 230 AD3d 597 , 598; People v Zhiminaicela-Duchitanga , 214 AD3d 1005 , 1006).

52,"The People of the State of New York, respondent, v Corben Smith, appellant.","Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Arthur F. Engoron, J.), entered June 27, 2024, awarding plaintiff a money judgment against defendant, and bringing up for review an order, same court and Justice, entered on or about March 26, 2024, which granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, unanimously affirmed, with costs. Defendant real estate appraiser was employed with Newmark Knight Frank Valuation & Advisory, LLC (Newmark) pursuant to an employment agreement. On December 17, 2017, plaintiff, an affiliate of Newmark, executed a cash advance distribution and promissory note with defendant under which plaintiff loaned defendant the principal sum of $255,937.50. As of the date of the note, defendant was also a partner with nonparty BGC Holdings, LP, another affiliate of plaintiff and Newmark. His limited partnership interest entitled him to receive prospective cash distributions. The note required defendant to pay principal and interest from partnership distributions until the note was fully satisfied. On September 2, 2020, defendant emailed his supervisor stating that he intended to stop performing his duties at Newmark. As a result, defendant was terminated from his employment with Newmark, ceased to provide services for Newmark, and ceased to be a limited partner in BGC Holdings. These events caused the outstanding amounts owed under the note to become immediately due and payable. Defendant's contention that the note was not immediately due and payable because he continued to provide services to Newmark is incorrect. Although the term ""services"" is not explicitly defined within the employment agreement, the agreement expressly states, under section 2, titled ""Duties,"" that ""Employee represents and warrants that Employee holds a current real estate appraisal license in and under the laws of any state where Employee renders appraisal services pursuant to this Agreement."" ""[B]ecause the terms of a contract must be read in context"" ( By Design LLC v Samsung Fire & Mar. Ins. Co. Ltd. [U.S. Branch] , 173 AD3d 590 , 591 [1st Dept 2019]), the term ""services,"" as used in the note, which was executed contemporaneously with the employment agreement, refers to defendant's duties under the employment agreement to render real estate appraisal services ( see Bijan Designer for Men v Fireman's Fund Ins. Co ., 264 AD2d 48, 52 [1st Dept 2000], lv denied 96 NY2d 707 [2001]). Sections 6 and 7 of the employment agreement, the non-solicitation and non-competition clauses, described post termination obligations, as opposed to affirmative duties to perform services ( see e.g. Process America, Inc. v Cynergy Holdings, LLC , 839 F3d 125, 137 [2d Cir 2016]). In addition, we reject defendant's argument that he did not cease to be a partner as that term is defined in the loan agreement with plaintiff. Although defendant is defined as a ""Partner"" in the note, the contemporaneously executed partnership agreements unequivocally state that partnership status ends following termination ( see 1471 Second Corp. v NAT of NY Corp. , 162 AD3d 449 , 450 [1st Dept 2018] [""agreements executed at substantially the same time and related to the same subject matter are regarded as contemporaneous writings and must be read together as one"" (internal quotation marks omitted)]). Defendant's argument concerning the receipt of non-exchangeable partnership units does not change this result."
53,"Bank of New York Mellon, etc., respondent, v Fenimore St. Realty, Inc., appellant, et al., defendants.","In a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 4, the father appeals from an order of the Family Court, Suffolk County (Alfred C. Graf, J.), dated April 2, 2024. The order, insofar as appealed from, denied the father's objections to so much of an order of the same court (Darlene Jorif-Mangane, S.M.) dated January 16, 2024, as directed, after a hearing, and upon findings of fact dated January 12, 2024, that a judgment be entered in favor of the mother and against the father in the sum of $56,636.16 for child care arrears. 

ORDERED that the order dated April 2, 2024, is affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements. The parties have two children together, born in 2004 and 2006. A separation agreement, which was incorporated but not merged into the parties' judgment of divorce, among other things, required the father to pay $589.96 per month to the mother for his pro rata share of child care expenses. In July 2023, the mother filed a petition alleging, inter alia, that the father had failed to make the required child care payments. After a hearing, the Support Magistrate, in an order dated January 16, 2024, among other things, directed that a judgment be entered in favor of the mother and against the father in the sum of $56,636.16 for child care arrears, upon finding that the father failed to make any child care payments from October 2009 through September 2017. In February 2024, the father filed objections, inter alia, to that portion of the Support Magistrate's order. In an order dated April 2, 2024, the Family Court, among other things, denied those objections. The father appeals. ""The settlement agreement is a contract subject to principles of contract interpretation"" ( Rainbow v Swisher , 72 NY2d 106, 109 ; see Cervera v Cervera , 218 AD3d 636 , 638). ""If not merged, the agreement may survive as a basis for suit, independent of other available procedures for enforcing the decree"" ( Rainbow v Swisher , 72 NY2d at 109 ). ""Where . . . the contract is clear and unambiguous on its face, the intent of the parties must be gleaned from within the four corners of the instrument, and not from extrinsic evidence"" ( id. ). Therefore, the court should construe the agreement in such a way as to ""give fair meaning to all of the language employed by the parties to reach a practical interpretation of the expressions of the parties so that their reasonable expectations will be realized"" ( Rhoda v Rhoda , 175 AD3d 1572 , 1573). ""Whether an agreement is ambiguous is a question of law for the courts"" ( Matter of Louie v Plissner , 174 AD3d 607 , 609). The Family Court correctly determined that the father was obligated to pay monthly child care expenses to the mother as stipulated under the terms of the settlement agreement. Further, contrary to the father's contention, the language of the agreement did not include a requirement that the mother provide evidence of child care expenses."
54,"Facade Technology, LLC, etc., Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant, v CNY Construction 701 LLC et al., Defendants-Appellants-Respondents, CNY Group LLC et al., Defendants.","In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the defendants appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Rachel E. Freier, J.), dated April 20, 2023. The order denied the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to a physical examination and provide authorizations to obtain certain records related to a prior motor vehicle accident. 

ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. The plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for personal injuries he allegedly sustained when he tripped and fell on a sidewalk defect abutting property owned by the defendant 501 EMR, LLC. Issue was joined and discovery was conducted. A note of issue was filed by the plaintiff on October 11, 2022. The defendants did not move to vacate the note of issue. In April 2023, the defendants moved to compel the plaintiff to submit to a physical examination and provide authorizations to obtain certain records related to a prior motor vehicle accident. In an order dated April 20, 2023, the Supreme Court denied the defendants' motion. The defendants appeal. The defendants waived their right to conduct a physical examination of the plaintiff by failing to arrange such examination within the time period set forth in prior orders, and by failing to move to vacate the note of issue within 20 days after service of the note of issue and certificate of readiness ( see Arroyo v Lacuesta , 140 AD3d 994, 994 ; Gianacopoulos v Corona , 133 AD3d 565, 565 ). Although further discovery after the note of issue is filed will be permitted if a defendant can demonstrate that ""unusual or unanticipated circumstances"" developed subsequent to the filing of the note of issue which required additional discovery to prevent substantial prejudice (22 NYCRR 202.21[d]; see Sullivan v R & J Mobility Serv., Inc. , 214 AD3d 839 , 841; Roye v Gelberg , 172 AD3d 1260 , 1262), 

here, the defendants submitted no evidence of unusual or unanticipated circumstances. The defendants' remaining contentions are without merit. 

Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly denied the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to a physical examination and provide authorizations to obtain certain records related to a prior motor vehicle accident ( see Roye v Gelberg , 172 AD3d at 1262; City of New York v Anton , 169 AD3d 999 , 1002; Silverberg v Guzman , 61 AD3d 955, 956 )."

Prisco, J.), rendered June 24, 2022, convicting him of attempted assault in the first degree, upon his plea of guilty, and imposing sentence. 

ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. The defendant's challenge to the validity of his plea of guilty is unpreserved for appellate review ( see People v Bellamy , 235 AD3d 994 , 994; People v Myke , 232 AD3d 913 ). In any event, the record establishes that the defendant's plea of guilty was made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently ( see People v Fiumefreddo , 82 NY2d 536, 543 ). Appellate review of the defendant's challenge to the County Court's Sandoval ruling ( see People v Sandoval , 34 NY2d 371 ) is foreclosed by his plea of guilty ( see People v Stinson , 189 AD3d 1271 , 1272; People v Sirico , 135 AD3d 19, 24 ). Contrary to the defendant's contention, the record demonstrates that he validly waived his right to appeal ( see People v Bryant , 28 NY3d 1094 ; People v Batista , 167 AD3d 69 , 73-74). Appellate review of the defendant's challenge to the County Court's suppression determination is precluded by his valid appeal waiver ( see People v Hightower-Castro , 219 AD3d 504 , 505) and was waived by the defendant withdrawing his motions as a condition of his plea of guilty ( see People v Cabot , 210 AD3d 902 )."

57,"U.S. Bank National Association, etc., Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent, v DLJ Mortgage Capital, Inc., et al., Defendants-Respondents-Appellants.","Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Robert M. Mandelbaum, J.), rendered December 2, 2022, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of predatory sexual assault against a child and endangering the welfare of a child, and sentencing him to an aggregate term of 25 years to life, unanimously affirmed. The court properly granted the People's motion to amend the indictment to expand the timeframe for the continuing crime of predatory sexual assault against a child based on the victim's statements indicating that the charged abuse continued for several months beyond the end date originally stated in the indictment ( see People v Sinha , 84 AD3d 35, 44-45 [1st Dept 2011], affd 19 NY3d 932 [2012]; see also People v Pabon , 28 NY3d 147, 154 [2016]; People v Mayette , 233 AD3d 1097 , 1102 [3d Dept 2024]). Defendant's argument that, independent of the motion to amend, the prosecutor constructively amended the indictment by eliciting allegations of criminal conduct different from that presented in the grand jury is unpreserved, and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we find that the challenged testimony was not improper where the indictment tracked the language of the statute, which does not require proof of a particular crime or type of sexual conduct ( see People v Colletti , 73 AD3d 1203, 1206 [2d Dept 2010], lv denied 15 NY3d 772 [2010]). Defendant's identification of various inconsistencies in the testimony of the child-victim does not warrant the conclusion that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence ( see People v Danielson , 9 NY3d 342, 348 [2007]). The victim testified specifically regarding 11 incidents of sexual assault among the scores of incidents in which he was molested by defendant, including numerous detailed descriptions of sexual conduct. While no other person witnessed defendant's horrific crimes, other evidence, including evidence of a marked change in the victim's behavior that correlated with the accusations of abuse, corroborated the victim's account. We perceive no basis for reducing defendant's sentence."

(Anonymous), etc. MercyFirst, respondent; Christopher M. L. (Anonymous), etc., et al., appellants. (Proceeding No. 3.)","Appeal by the defendant, as limited by his motion, from a sentence of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Joseph E. Gubbay, J., at plea; Matthew J. D'Emic, J., at sentence), imposed January 25, 2023, upon his plea of guilty, on the ground that the sentence was excessive. 

ORDERED that the sentence is affirmed. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the defendant's purported waiver of the right to appeal was invalid. ""The trial courts must be sure to obtain, on the record, an affirmative response from the defendant that he or she understands the rights as explained, that the defendant is giving up those rights, and that the defendant is doing so voluntarily after discussing same with counsel"" ( People v Deas , 228 AD3d 954 , 954 [internal quotation marks omitted]). 

Here, the Supreme Court never elicited an acknowledgment that the defendant was voluntarily waiving his right to appeal ( see id. ; People v Habersham , 186 AD3d 854 , 854-855) and did not ensure that he understood the distinction between the right to appeal and the rights automatically forfeited upon entering a plea of guilty ( see People v Soto , 169 AD3d 937 , 937-938). Moreover, the court's oral colloquy mischaracterized the appellate rights waived as encompassing the loss of attendant rights to counsel and a waiver of costs, fees, and expenses ( see People v Burris , 231 AD3d 1063 , 1063-1064; People v Erdaide , 216 AD3d 1178 , 1178). Under the circumstances, the defendant's execution of a written waiver of the right to appeal did not cure the deficient oral colloquy ( see People v Burris , 231 AD3d at 1064; People v Deas , 228 AD3d at 954). 

Accordingly, the purported waiver does not preclude appellate review of the defendant's excessive sentence claim. Nevertheless, the sentence imposed was not excessive ( see People v Suitte , 90 AD2d 80 )."
