# NLP Project Self-Review Template

Use this to check if your project tells a clear story and shows applied reasoning.

## 1. What Did I Build?
- Describe the system’s functionality in one or two clear sentences.

## 2. What Problem Does It Solve?
- Why would someone actually want or need this?

## 3. What Was My Data?
- Where did the data come from?
- Why is it suitable or realistic for this use case?
- What are the limitations?

## 4. What Techniques Did I Use, and Why?
- Why did I choose TF-IDF first?
- Why didn’t I apply more advanced models upfront?
- Why didn’t I do custom tokenization?

## 5. What Trade-offs Did I Accept?
- Did I optimize for speed over depth?
- Did I prioritize practical outcomes over theoretical completeness?

## 6. What’s Missing or Could Be Improved?
- What are the next steps?
- What known limitations remain?
- How could this be made production-ready?

## 7. Interview-Ready Justification Summary
- If asked “Why did you do it this way?”
  - Can you explain the goal you were solving for?
  - Why your choices were reasonable for that goal?
  - What you might change if you had more time or resources?
