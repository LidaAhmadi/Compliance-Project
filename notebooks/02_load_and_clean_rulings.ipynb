Pursuant to People v De Bour ( 40 NY2d 210 ), there is \"a graduated four-level test for evaluating the propriety of police encounters when a police officer is acting in a law enforcement capacity\" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d 869 , 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ). \"The first level permits a police officer to request information from an individual, and merely requires that the request be supported by an objective, credible reason, not necessarily indicative of criminality\" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"The second level, known as the common-law right of inquiry, requires a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, and permits a somewhat greater intrusion\" ( id . [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"Based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, the subject may be asked to produce identification, may be asked whether he [or she] has weapons, and may be asked to remove his [or her] hands from his [or her] pockets\" ( Matter of Shakir J. , 119 AD3d 792, 794-795 [citation omitted]; see People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ; People v Muhammed , 196 AD3d 1151 , 1152-1153). \"The third level permits a police officer to forcibly stop and detain an individual\" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"Such a detention, however, is not permitted unless there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime\" ( id .

The judgment, upon an order of the same court entered March 15, 2023, granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to enter a default judgment, is in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed, with costs. On December 2, 2021, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant, alleging that the plaintiff and the defendant reached an agreement pursuant to which the plaintiff would purchase the defendant's grocery store and restaurant for $440,940. In consideration of that agreement, the plaintiff made installment payments totaling $40,000 to the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant rescinded the agreement and did not return the sum of $40,000. The plaintiff asserted, in effect, causes of action to recover damages for money had and received and unjust enrichment. On December 7, 2021, the plaintiff served the defendant with the summons and complaint. On December 22, 2021, the defendant's counsel filed a notice of appearance. Thereafter, the defendant failed to answer the complaint. In December 2022, the plaintiff moved for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant. By order entered March 15, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion. On March 17, 2023, a judgment, upon the order, was entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. \n",
      "\n",
      "The defendant appeals. \"'On a motion for leave to enter a default judgment against a defendant based on the failure to answer or appear, a plaintiff must submit proof of service of the summons and complaint, proof of the facts constituting the cause of action, and proof of the defendant's default'\" ( Nationstar Mtge., LLC v Gross , 201 AD3d 942 , 944, quoting L & Z Masonry Corp. v Mose , 167 AD3d 728 , 729; see CPLR 3215[f]). \"Since defaulters are deemed to have admitted all factual allegations contained in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that flow from them, when submitting proof of facts constituting a claim, a plaintiff need only set forth enough facts to enable the Supreme Court to determine that the plaintiff alleged a viable cause of action\" ( Rosenzweig v Gubner , 194 AD3d 1086 , 1088 [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Global Liberty Ins. Co. v Haar Orthopaedics & Sports Med., P.C. , 170 AD3d 1125 , 1126). \"To defeat a facially sufficient CPLR 3215 motion, a defendant must show either that there was no default, or that it had a reasonable excuse for its delay and a potentially meritorious defense\" ( National Loan Invs., L.P. v Bruno , 191 AD3d 999 , 1001; see U.S. Bank N.A. v Crockett , 201 AD3d 767 , 768). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, in support of her motion for leave to enter a default judgment, the plaintiff made the required showing by submitting proof of service of the summons and complaint, proof of the facts constituting the causes of action, and proof of the defendant's default. In opposition, the defendant contended that she was not in default because her counsel served a notice of appearance. However, service of a notice of appearance does not \"'absolve a defendant from complying with the time restrictions imposed by CPLR 320(a) which govern the service of an answer or the making of a motion pursuant to CPLR 3211'\" ( 21st Mtge. Corp. v Raghu , 197 AD3d 1212 , 1216, quoting Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v Hall , 185 AD3d 1006 , 1009-1010; see CPLR 320(a); 3211). Similarly, the defendant's contention that her failure to timely answer should be excused because the plaintiff did not respond to the demand for service of the summons and complaint in the notice of appearance is without merit, since the plaintiff had already properly served a summons and complaint ( see CPLR 320[a], [b]; 3211[a][8]; Travelon, Inc. v Maekitan , 215 AD3d 710 , 713-714; 21st Mtge. Corp. v Raghu , 197 AD3d at 1216). The defendant's contention that her default should be excused due to law office failure is improperly raised for the first time on appeal ( see Matter of Regina Metro. Co., LLC v New York State Div. of Hous. & Community Renewal , 35 NY3d 332 , 362-363; Crudele v Price , 218 AD3d 534 , 536). In light of the defendant's failure to establish a reasonable excuse for her default, it is unnecessary to determine whether she demonstrated a potentially meritorious defense ( see U.S. Bank N.A. v Carucci , 217 AD3d 894 , 895; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Eliacin , 206 AD3d 950 , 952).

      "In an action, inter alia, for injunctive relief and to recover damages for trespass, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Carolyn E. Wade, J.), dated February 27, 2024. The order denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and, in effect, granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, among other things, to access the plaintiff's real property, subject to certain conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. The plaintiff and the defendant own adjacent real properties located in Brooklyn. In 2019, in furtherance of the defendant's plan to construct a building on its property, the parties entered into a license agreement. The plaintiff agreed to permit the defendant to access the plaintiff's property and to install \"TEMPORARY PROTECTIONS\" on the plaintiff's property, including, monitoring equipment, a construction fence on the lot line, and a construction shed and scaffold in the plaintiff's rear yard. In consideration, the defendant agreed, inter alia, to pay to the plaintiff a monthly licensing fee, commencing upon the installation of the temporary protections. The defendant deposited with the plaintiff's attorney licensing fees for the first six months, to be held in escrow. However, the defendant's project was delayed and it is undisputed that the term of the license agreement expired on October 22, 2021, without the defendant ever having entered upon the plaintiff's property. The funds held in escrow were not returned to the defendant. In 2023, the parties attempted to negotiate a new license agreement, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, in September 2023, the defendant entered upon the plaintiff's property and installed temporary protections. The defendant then began construction of its building. On or about January 24, 2024, the plaintiff commenced this action, among other things, for an injunction directing the defendant to remove the temporary protections and to refrain from entering upon the plaintiff's property and to recover damages for trespass. The following day, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. Invoking RPAPL 881, the defendant cross-moved for a license, inter alia, to access the plaintiff's property. The Supreme Court granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, upon certain specified conditions, including the payment of monthly licensing fees as set forth in the 2019 license agreement, with a credit for the fees already paid, and requirements that the defendant name the plaintiff as an additional insured on its commercial general liability insurance policy and repair any physical damage to the plaintiff's property caused by the defendant's access. The court also denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff appeals. RPAPL 881 allows an owner of real property planning to make improvements thereon to seek a license to enter the premises of an adjoining owner when such entry is necessary to make the improvements and the adjoining owner has refused such access ( see id. ; Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d 833 , 834). In determining whether to grant a license pursuant to RPAPL 881, the court may consider the following factors: \"the nature and extent of the requested access, the duration of the access, the protections to the adjoining property that are needed, the lack of an alternative means to perform the work, the public interest in the completion of the project, and the measures in place to ensure the financial compensation of the adjoining owner for any damage or inconvenience resulting from the intrusion\" ( Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835; see Matter of Queens Coll. Special Projects Fund, Inc. v Newman , 154 AD3d 943, 944 ). In general, \"[c]ourts are required to balance the interests of the parties and should issue a license when necessary, under reasonable conditions, and where the inconvenience to the adjacent property owner is relatively slight compared to the hardship of his [or her] neighbor if the license is refused\" ( Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the Supreme Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in issuing a license to the defendant with specified conditions. The defendant's evidence demonstrated that the temporary protections would be in place for no more than 12 months and were necessary for the defendant to construct its building while protecting the plaintiff's property in accordance with the requirements of the New York City Building Code ( see Matter of Queens Coll. Special Projects Fund, Inc. v Newman , 154 AD3d at 944 ). Further, the plaintiff would be protected financially by the defendant's payment of substantial monthly licensing fees, being named as an additional insured on the defendant's insurance policy, and the defendant's payment for any physical damage to the plaintiff's property ( see id. ; Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835). In opposition to the defendant's showing, the plaintiff did not submit any evidence, such as an opposing expert affidavit, to show that, or to raise any triable issues of fact as to whether, the temporary protections were unnecessary or unreasonable or that the balance of the parties' interests required denial of the license. Further, as no triable issues of fact were raised, the plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing on the defendant's request for a license ( see RPAPL 881; CPLR 409). Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the Supreme Court's granting of a license did not serve to excuse, after the fact, the defendant's trespass on the plaintiff's property. The license was not granted nunc pro tunc to the defendant's entry onto the plaintiff's property in September 2023. Nor was such relief requested by the defendant. Thus, the defendant's use of the plaintiff's property was licensed only as of the issuance of the court's order. Contrary to the plaintiff's further contention, in issuing the license, the Supreme Court had the authority to impose \"such terms as justice requires,\" including the terms to which the parties had previously agreed in the 2019 license agreement (RPAPL 881). The conditions imposed by the court were not an improvident exercise of its discretion. The Supreme Court also did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. \"Although the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial, the remedy is considered a drastic one, which should be used sparingly\" ( Soundview Cinemas, Inc. v AC I Soundview, LLC , 149 AD3d 1121, 1123 ). \"To obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant must establish (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction, and (3) a balancing of the equities in the movant's favor\" ( Samaha v Brooklyn Bridge Park Corp. , 230 AD3d 608 , 610 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see CPLR 6301). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, while the plaintiff showed a likelihood of success on its cause of action to recover damages for the past trespass ( see Umlas v Britton , 222 AD3d 1031 , 1032; Shrage v Con Edison Co. , 216 AD3d 1023 , 1025-1026), it is not likely to succeed on its cause of action for an injunction in light of the order granting the defendant's cross-motion for a license ( see Spatafore v U.S. Bank Trust N.A. , 231 AD3d 985 , 986). Furthermore, even absent the granting of the license, at the point when the plaintiff made its motion, the balance of the equities favored the defendant. Among other things, the defendant demonstrated that removal of the temporary protections at that time would have endangered the plaintiff's property, the occupants of the property, and the general public. Further, the defendant accessed the plaintiff's property under conditions to which the plaintiff had previously agreed and for which it had been partially paid. Under the circumstances, even without considering the license granted to the defendant in the order, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to a preliminary injunction ( see Soundview Cinemas, Inc. v AC I Soundview, LLC , 149 AD3d at 1124 ). The parties' remaining contentions are either without merit or not properly before this Court as they are based on matter dehors the record. \n",

    "## Step 7: Extract Party Information from Rulings\n",
    "\n",
    "We extract the named parties in each case for later use in search, filtering, or metadata tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristic:\n",
    "- Locate the `[âˆ—1]` marker, which precedes party listings\n",
    "- Grab the next two non-empty lines:\n",
    "  - Line containing respondent/plaintiff\n",
    "  - Line containing appellant/defendant\n",
    "- Combine into a single string like `Party A v Party B`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Extract Parties?\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting parties helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index or group rulings by case participants (e.g., recurring litigants)\n",
    "- Enable user-friendly display of results in dashboards or semantic search tools\n",
    "- Link to related court data or filings based on party names\n",
    "\n",
    "While other metadata (like judge names, docket numbers, or decision dates) can also be extracted for deeper analysis or filtering, weâ€™re currently prioritizing decision content and party identity to support our IR/NLP pipeline. Those fields can be layered in later as needed."
