    "## Step 5: Extract Party Information from Rulings\n",
    "\n",
    "We extract the named parties in each case for later use in search, filtering, or metadata tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristic:\n",
    "- Locate the `[âˆ—1]` marker, which precedes party listings\n",
    "- Grab the next two non-empty lines:\n",
    "  - Line containing respondent/plaintiff\n",
    "  - Line containing appellant/defendant\n",
    "- Combine into a single string like `Party A v Party B`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Extract Parties?\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting parties helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Index or group rulings by case participants (e.g., recurring litigants)\n",
    "- Enable user-friendly display of results in dashboards or semantic search tools\n",
    "- Link to related court data or filings based on party names\n",
    "\n",
    "While other metadata (like judge names, docket numbers, or decision dates) can also be extracted for deeper analysis or filtering, weâ€™re currently prioritizing decision content and party identity to support our IR/NLP pipeline. Those fields can be layered in later as needed."
