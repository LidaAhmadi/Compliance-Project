<br><br>
<p>Patricia Pazner, New York, NY (Mark W. Vorkink of counsel), for appellant.</p>
<p>Melinda Katz, District Attorney, Kew Gardens, NY (Johnnette Traill, Nancy Fitzpatrick Talcott, and Nicholas Isaacson of counsel), for respondent.</p>
<br><br>


<p>DECISION &amp; ORDER</p>
<p>Appeals by the defendant from two judgments of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Michael Aloise, J.), both rendered July 24, 2018, convicting him of burglary in the second degree (three counts) under Indictment No. 2833/16, and burglary in the second degree (two counts) under Indictment No. 2834/16, upon his pleas of guilty, and imposing sentences.</p>
<p>ORDERED that the judgments are affirmed.</p>
<p>The defendant's contention that his sentences as a persistent violent felony offender (<i>see</i> Penal Law ยง 70.08) are unconstitutional in light of <i>Erlinger v United States</i> (<span class="citation no-link">602 US 821</span>) is unpreserved for appellate review, as the defendant failed to raise a constitutional challenge before the Supreme Court (<i>see</i> CPL 470.05[2]; <i>People v Rosen</i>, <span class="citation" data-id="2167215"><a href="/opinion/2167215/people-v-rosen/#335" aria-description="Citation for case: People v. Rosen">96 NY2d 329, 335</a></span>; <i>People v Locenitt</i>, <span class="citation no-link">157 AD3d 905</span>, 907-908). We decline to review it in the exercise of our interest of justice jurisdiction (<i>see People v Bynum</i>, <span class="citation no-link">225 AD3d 781</span>, 781).</p>
<p>DILLON, J.P., CONNOLLY, LANDICINO and MCCORMACK, JJ., concur.</p>
