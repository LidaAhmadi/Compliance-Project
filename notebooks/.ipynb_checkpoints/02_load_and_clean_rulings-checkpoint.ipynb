[internal quotation marks omitted]). \"Based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, the subject may be asked to produce identification, may be asked whether he [or she] has weapons, and may be asked to remove his [or her] hands from his [or her] pockets\" ( Matter of Shakir J. , 119 AD3d 792, 794-795 [citation omitted]; see People v Alleyne , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01941 ; People v Muhammed , 196 AD3d 1151 , 1152-1153). \"The third level permits a police officer to forcibly stop and detain an individual\" ( People v Benbow , 193 AD3d at 871 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"Such a detention, however, is not permitted unless there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime\" ( id .

The judgment, upon an order of the same court entered March 15, 2023, granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to enter a default judgment, is in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed, with costs. On December 2, 2021, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant, alleging that the plaintiff and the defendant reached an agreement pursuant to which the plaintiff would purchase the defendant's grocery store and restaurant for $440,940. In consideration of that agreement, the plaintiff made installment payments totaling $40,000 to the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant rescinded the agreement and did not return the sum of $40,000. The plaintiff asserted, in effect, causes of action to recover damages for money had and received and unjust enrichment. On December 7, 2021, the plaintiff served the defendant with the summons and complaint. On December 22, 2021, the defendant's counsel filed a notice of appearance. Thereafter, the defendant failed to answer the complaint. In December 2022, the plaintiff moved for leave to enter a default judgment against the defendant. By order entered March 15, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion. On March 17, 2023, a judgment, upon the order, was entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the principal sum of $40,000. \n",
      "\n",

Co. v Haar Orthopaedics & Sports Med., P.C. , 170 AD3d 1125 , 1126). \"To defeat a facially sufficient CPLR 3215 motion, a defendant must show either that there was no default, or that it had a reasonable excuse for its delay and a potentially meritorious defense\" ( National Loan Invs., L.P. v Bruno , 191 AD3d 999 , 1001; see U.S. Bank N.A. v Crockett , 201 AD3d 767 , 768). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, in support of her motion for leave to enter a default judgment, the plaintiff made the required showing by submitting proof of service of the summons and complaint, proof of the facts constituting the causes of action, and proof of the defendant's default. In opposition, the defendant contended that she was not in default because her counsel served a notice of appearance. However, service of a notice of appearance does not \"'absolve a defendant from complying with the time restrictions imposed by CPLR 320(a) which govern the service of an answer or the making of a motion pursuant to CPLR 3211'\" ( 21st Mtge. Corp. v Raghu , 197 AD3d 1212 , 1216, quoting Deutsche Bank Natl. Trust Co. v Hall , 185 AD3d 1006 , 1009-1010; see CPLR 320(a); 3211). Similarly, the defendant's contention that her failure to timely answer should be excused because the plaintiff did not respond to the demand for service of the summons and complaint in the notice of appearance is without merit, since the plaintiff had already properly served a summons and complaint ( see CPLR 320[a], [b]; 3211[a][8]; Travelon, Inc. v Maekitan , 215 AD3d 710 , 713-714; 21st Mtge. Corp. v Raghu , 197 AD3d at 1216). The defendant's contention that her default should be excused due to law office failure is improperly raised for the first time on appeal ( see Matter of Regina Metro. Co., LLC v New York State Div. of Hous. & Community Renewal , 35 NY3d 332 , 362-363; Crudele v Price , 218 AD3d 534 , 536). In light of the defendant's failure to establish a reasonable excuse for her default, it is unnecessary to determine whether she demonstrated a potentially meritorious defense ( see U.S. Bank N.A. v Carucci , 217 AD3d 894 , 895; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v Eliacin , 206 AD3d 950 , 952).

      "In an action, inter alia, for injunctive relief and to recover damages for trespass, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Carolyn E. Wade, J.), dated February 27, 2024. The order denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and, in effect, granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, among other things, to access the plaintiff's real property, subject to certain conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. The plaintiff and the defendant own adjacent real properties located in Brooklyn. In 2019, in furtherance of the defendant's plan to construct a building on its property, the parties entered into a license agreement. The plaintiff agreed to permit the defendant to access the plaintiff's property and to install \"TEMPORARY PROTECTIONS\" on the plaintiff's property, including, monitoring equipment, a construction fence on the lot line, and a construction shed and scaffold in the plaintiff's rear yard. In consideration, the defendant agreed, inter alia, to pay to the plaintiff a monthly licensing fee, commencing upon the installation of the temporary protections. The defendant deposited with the plaintiff's attorney licensing fees for the first six months, to be held in escrow. However, the defendant's project was delayed and it is undisputed that the term of the license agreement expired on October 22, 2021, without the defendant ever having entered upon the plaintiff's property. The funds held in escrow were not returned to the defendant. In 2023, the parties attempted to negotiate a new license agreement, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, in September 2023, the defendant entered upon the plaintiff's property and installed temporary protections. The defendant then began construction of its building. On or about January 24, 2024, the plaintiff commenced this action, among other things, for an injunction directing the defendant to remove the temporary protections and to refrain from entering upon the plaintiff's property and to recover damages for trespass. The following day, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. Invoking RPAPL 881, the defendant cross-moved for a license, inter alia, to access the plaintiff's property. The Supreme Court granted the defendant's cross-motion for a license, upon certain specified conditions, including the payment of monthly licensing fees as set forth in the 2019 license agreement, with a credit for the fees already paid, and requirements that the defendant name the plaintiff as an additional insured on its commercial general liability insurance policy and repair any physical damage to the plaintiff's property caused by the defendant's access. The court also denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff appeals. RPAPL 881 allows an owner of real property planning to make improvements thereon to seek a license to enter the premises of an adjoining owner when such entry is necessary to make the improvements and the adjoining owner has refused such access ( see id. ; Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d 833 , 834). In determining whether to grant a license pursuant to RPAPL 881, the court may consider the following factors: \"the nature and extent of the requested access, the duration of the access, the protections to the adjoining property that are needed, the lack of an alternative means to perform the work, the public interest in the completion of the project, and the measures in place to ensure the financial compensation of the adjoining owner for any damage or inconvenience resulting from the intrusion\" ( Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835; see Matter of Queens Coll. Special Projects Fund, Inc. v Newman , 154 AD3d 943, 944 ). In general, \"[c]ourts are required to balance the interests of the parties and should issue a license when necessary, under reasonable conditions, and where the inconvenience to the adjacent property owner is relatively slight compared to the hardship of his [or her] neighbor if the license is refused\" ( Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the Supreme Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in issuing a license to the defendant with specified conditions. The defendant's evidence demonstrated that the temporary protections would be in place for no more than 12 months and were necessary for the defendant to construct its building while protecting the plaintiff's property in accordance with the requirements of the New York City Building Code ( see Matter of Queens Coll. Special Projects Fund, Inc. v Newman , 154 AD3d at 944 ). Further, the plaintiff would be protected financially by the defendant's payment of substantial monthly licensing fees, being named as an additional insured on the defendant's insurance policy, and the defendant's payment for any physical damage to the plaintiff's property ( see id. ; Matter of Voron v Board of Mgrs. of Newswalk Condominium , 186 AD3d at 835). In opposition to the defendant's showing, the plaintiff did not submit any evidence, such as an opposing expert affidavit, to show that, or to raise any triable issues of fact as to whether, the temporary protections were unnecessary or unreasonable or that the balance of the parties' interests required denial of the license. Further, as no triable issues of fact were raised, the plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing on the defendant's request for a license ( see RPAPL 881; CPLR 409). Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the Supreme Court's granting of a license did not serve to excuse, after the fact, the defendant's trespass on the plaintiff's property. The license was not granted nunc pro tunc to the defendant's entry onto the plaintiff's property in September 2023. Nor was such relief requested by the defendant. Thus, the defendant's use of the plaintiff's property was licensed only as of the issuance of the court's order. Contrary to the plaintiff's further contention, in issuing the license, the Supreme Court had the authority to impose \"such terms as justice requires,\" including the terms to which the parties had previously agreed in the 2019 license agreement (RPAPL 881). The conditions imposed by the court were not an improvident exercise of its discretion. The Supreme Court also did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. \"Although the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial, the remedy is considered a drastic one, which should be used sparingly\" ( Soundview Cinemas, Inc. v AC I Soundview, LLC , 149 AD3d 1121, 1123 ). \"To obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant must establish (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction, and (3) a balancing of the equities in the movant's favor\" ( Samaha v Brooklyn Bridge Park Corp. , 230 AD3d 608 , 610 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see CPLR 6301). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, while the plaintiff showed a likelihood of success on its cause of action to recover damages for the past trespass ( see Umlas v Britton , 222 AD3d 1031 , 1032; Shrage v Con Edison Co. , 216 AD3d 1023 , 1025-1026), it is not likely to succeed on its cause of action for an injunction in light of the order granting the defendant's cross-motion for a license ( see Spatafore v U.S. Bank Trust N.A. , 231 AD3d 985 , 986). Furthermore, even absent the granting of the license, at the point when the plaintiff made its motion, the balance of the equities favored the defendant. Among other things, the defendant demonstrated that removal of the temporary protections at that time would have endangered the plaintiff's property, the occupants of the property, and the general public. Further, the defendant accessed the plaintiff's property under conditions to which the plaintiff had previously agreed and for which it had been partially paid. Under the circumstances, even without considering the license granted to the defendant in the order, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to a preliminary injunction ( see Soundview Cinemas, Inc. v AC I Soundview, LLC , 149 AD3d at 1124 ). The parties' remaining contentions are either without merit or not properly before this Court as they are based on matter dehors the record. \n",

      "ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, without costs or disbursements, the family offense petition and the violation petition are reinstated, and the matter is remitted to the Family Court, Kings County, for a hearing to determine whether the Family Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Family Court Act Â§ 812(1)(e) and further proceedings thereafter, if warranted. The petitioner and her former husband have a child in common. In May 2021, the petitioner filed a family offense petition on behalf of the child, against the respondent, the paramour of the former husband. On October 7, 2022, a temporary order of protection was issued, inter alia, in favor of the child, and the petitioner subsequently filed another petition on behalf of the child, alleging that the respondent violated the temporary order of protection. The Family Court, without conducting a hearing, dismissed the family offense petition and the violation petition on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The petitioner appeals. The \"Family Court is a court of limited jurisdiction that cannot exercise powers beyond those granted to it by statute\" ( Matter of Eno v Illovsky , 214 AD3d 865 , 866 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Silverman v Leibowitz , 208 AD3d 1332 , 1333). \"Pursuant to Family Court Act Â§ 812(1), the Family Court's jurisdiction in family offense proceedings is limited to certain prescribed acts that occur between spouses or former spouses, or between parent and child or between members of the same family or household\" ( Matter of Watson v Brown , 225 AD3d 613 , 614 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Raigosa v Zafirakopoulos , 167 AD3d 748 , 748). \"'[M]embers of the same family or household' include, among others, 'persons who are not related by consanguinity or affinity and who are or have been in an intimate relationship regardless of whether such persons have lived together at any time'\" ( Matter of Woldeselassie v Colon , 227 AD3d 725 , 726, quoting Family Ct Act Â§ 812[1][e]; see Matter of Watson v Brown , 225 AD3d at 614). \"Beyond expressly excluding from the definition of 'intimate relationship' a 'casual acquaintance' and 'ordinary fraternization between two individuals in business or social contexts'\" ( Matter of Eno v Illovsky , 214 AD3d at 867, quoting Family Ct Act Â§ 812[1][e]), \"the [L]egislature left it to the courts to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what qualifies as an 'intimate relationship' within the meaning of Family Court Act Â§ 812(1)(e)\" ( Matter of Jose M. v Angel V. , 99 AD3d 243 , 247; see Matter of Eno v Illovsky , 214 AD3d at 867; Matter of Rizzo v Pravato , 170 AD3d 860 , 861). The factors that a court may consider while making such a determination are \"the nature or type of relationship, regardless of whether the relationship is sexual in nature; the frequency of interaction between the persons; and the duration of the relationship\" (Family Ct Act Â§ 812[1][e]; see Matter of Silverman v Leibowitz , 208 AD3d at 1333). \"[T]he determination as to whether persons are or have been in an 'intimate relationship' within the meaning of Family Court Act Â§ 812(1)(e) is a fact-specific determination which may require a hearing\" ( Matter of Jose M. v Angel V. , 99 AD3d at 249; see Matter of Raigosa v Zafirakopoulos , 167 AD3d at 749). \n",

The issues raised on the appeal from the order dated January 19, 2023, are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale ( see CPLR 5501[a][1]). In March 2017, the plaintiff commenced this action to foreclose a mortgage against the defendant Dale Bente (hereinafter the defendant), among others. The plaintiff subsequently moved, inter alia, for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against the defendant and for an order of reference. In support of its motion, the plaintiff submitted, among other things, an affidavit of an assistant vice president of the plaintiff, who, based upon her review of the plaintiff's business records, inter alia, attested to the defendant's default in payment. In an order dated November 20, 2018, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted those branches of the plaintiff's motion. In February 2022, the plaintiff moved to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. The defendant opposed the plaintiff's motion and cross-moved for leave to renew her opposition to those branches of the plaintiff's prior motion which were for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against her and for an order of reference. The defendant's cross-motion was based on a purported change in the law with respect to establishing a defendant's default in payment. In an order dated January 19, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's motion and denied the defendant's cross-motion. Subsequently, in an order and judgment of foreclosure and sale entered February 7, 2023, the court, inter alia, confirmed the referee's report and directed the sale of the subject property. \n",

      "The defendant appeals. The Supreme Court properly denied the defendant's cross-motion for leave to renew her opposition to those branches of the plaintiff's prior motion which were for summary judgment on the complaint insofar as asserted against her and for an order of reference, since the defendant failed to demonstrate that there had been a change in the law that would have altered the prior determination ( see CPLR 2221[e][2]; U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. v McCobb , 222 AD3d 696 ). In any event, contrary to the defendant's contention, the business records on which the plaintiff's assistant vice president relied in attesting to the defendant's default in payment were attached to the affidavit of the assistant vice president, and the records themselves evinced the defendant's default ( see Citigroup v Kopelowitz , 147 AD3d 1014, 1015 ). Further, the Supreme Court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to confirm the referee's report and for a judgment of foreclosure and sale. Contrary to the defendant's contention, the failure of the referee to conduct a hearing does not require reversal of the order and judgment of foreclosure and sale, as the defendant had the opportunity to raise questions and submit relevant evidence to the court ( see U.S. Bank N.A. v Mays , 221 AD3d 934 , 935; Wilmington Trust, N.A. v Reed , 210 AD3d 731 , 732). Moreover, the referee's findings with respect to the total amount due upon the mortgage were substantially supported by the record ( see Wilmington Trust, N.A. v Reed , 210 AD3d at 732).\n",

In May 2017, this action, inter alia, to recover damages for medical malpractice was commenced against the defendants Ritha Alhindawi and Stephen Lastig (hereinafter together the defendants), among others. A note of issue was filed in January 2021. In July 2021, Alhindawi moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him, and Lastig separately moved, inter alia, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him. In May 2022, the plaintiff cross-moved for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Alhindawi and separately cross-moved for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Lastig. By order entered January 24, 2023, the Supreme Court, inter alia, denied the plaintiff's cross-motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Lastig. By order entered January 26, 2023, the court, among other things, denied the plaintiff's cross-motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars as to Alhindawi. The plaintiff appeals from both orders. \"Leave to amend a bill of particulars is ordinarily to be freely given in the absence of prejudice or surprise\" ( Lorincz v Castellano , 208 AD3d 573 , 574; see J.D.R.G. v Golden Brick Dev. JP, LLC , 217 AD3d 846 , 848). \"However, once discovery has been completed and the case has been certified for trial, a party will not be permitted to amend the bill of particulars except upon a showing of special and extraordinary circumstances\" ( Lorincz v Castellano , 208 AD3d at 574-575; see Achee v Merrick Vil., Inc. , 208 AD3d 542 , 542-543). \"Where the motion for leave to amend a pleading is made long after the action has been certified for trial, judicial discretion in allowing such amendments should be discrete, circumspect, prudent, and cautious\" ( Lorincz v Castellano , 208 AD3d at 575 [internal quotation marks omitted]). \"The determination to permit or deny the amendment is committed to the sound and broad discretion of the trial court, and its determination will not lightly be set aside\" ( Scopelliti v Westmed Med.

(one as to each child), all dated April 30, 2024. The orders of fact-finding and disposition, after fact-finding and dispositional hearings, found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the subject children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the subject children to the petitioner and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the orders of fact-finding and disposition are affirmed, without costs or disbursements. The petitioner, MercyFirst (hereinafter the agency), commenced these proceedings to terminate the parental rights of the mother and the father to the subject children on the ground of permanent neglect. Following fact-finding and dispositional hearings, the Family Court found that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children, terminated their parental rights, and transferred custody and guardianship of the children to the agency and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services of the City of New York for the purpose of adoption. The mother and the father separately appeal. \"When a foster care agency brings a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the ground of permanent neglect, it must, as a threshold matter, prove by clear and convincing evidence that it has fulfilled its statutory duty to exercise diligent efforts to encourage and strengthen the parent-child relationship\" ( Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d 732 , 733 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Naijah-S.G.B. [Thomas X.B.] , 230 AD3d 1314 , 1314). \"Those efforts must include counseling, making suitable arrangements for parental access, providing assistance to the parents to resolve the problems preventing the child's discharge, and advising the parents of the child's progress and development\" ( Matter of Christopher C. [Sonia C.] , 235 AD3d 865 , 856 [alteration and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 733). Once the agency demonstrates that it made diligent efforts to strengthen the parental relationship, it bears the burden of proving \"by clear and convincing evidence, that for a period of one year following the child's placement with the agency, the parent failed to maintain contact with the child or, alternatively, failed to plan for the future of the child, although physically and financially able to do so\" ( Matter of Daniel J.L. [Sayid L.] , 213 AD3d 939 , 940; see Social Services Law Â§ 384-b[7][a]). \"A parent who has only partially complied with his or her service plan and who has not gained insight into the issues that caused the removal of the child has not planned for the child's future\" ( Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 733). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the agency met its burden of establishing that the mother and the father permanently neglected the children. The agency demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that it made diligent efforts to strengthen each parent's relationship with the children by formulating a service plan that served each parent's needs, providing referrals to programs, explaining the importance of compliance with the service plan, and facilitating parental access between the parents and the children. Moreover, the record shows that the parents failed to plan for the children's futures, despite the agency's diligent efforts, as they only partially complied with their service plans ( see Matter of Damaris E.A. [Johanna A.M.] , 217 AD3d 860 , 861; Matter of Shimon G. [Batsheva G.] , 206 AD3d at 734). \n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the Family Court properly found that the parents permanently neglected the children. The evidence adduced at the dispositional hearing established that termination of the parental rights of the mother and the father was in the best interests of the children ( see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d 913 , 914; Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d 730 , 731). Contrary to the mother's contention, a suspended judgment would not be in the children's best interests, as such a disposition would \"only prolong the delay of stability and permanenc[y]\" in the children's lives ( Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d at 732; see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d at 914-915). Further, the record supports the Family Court's determination that the children's best interests would be served by freeing them for adoption by their respective foster parents, with whom each child has bonded and resided with over a prolonged period of time ( see Matter of Abbygail H.M.G. [Eddie G.] , 205 AD3d at 915; Matter of Elizabeth M.G.C. [Maria L.G.C.] , 190 AD3d at 732).\n",

Cairo, J.), dated September 15, 2023. The order granted the defendants' motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the amended complaint. \n",

      "ORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting those branches of the defendants' motion which were pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint, and substituting therefor a provision denying those branches of the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was formerly employed as a delivery driver by the defendant Krystal Fruits & Vegetables, Inc. (hereinafter Krystal). In January 2023, the plaintiff commenced this action against Krystal and its owner, the defendant Michael Longo, among other things, to recover damages for unpaid wages and failure to provide wage statements in violation of the Labor Law. The defendants moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1) and (7) to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiff opposed the motion and filed an amended complaint. In an order dated September 15, 2023, the Supreme Court considered the defendants' motion as directed against the amended complaint and granted the motion. The plaintiff appeals. We modify. \"On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), the complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction, the facts alleged are presumed to be true, the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of every favorable inference, and the court is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\" ( Gorbatov v Tsirelman , 155 AD3d 836, 837 ; see MJ Lilly Assoc., LLC v Ovis Creative, LLC , 221 AD3d 805 , 807). \"Where evidentiary material is submitted and considered on a motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), and the motion is not converted into one for summary judgment, the question becomes whether the plaintiff has a cause of action, not whether the plaintiff has stated one and, unless it has been shown that a material fact as claimed by the plaintiff to be one is not a fact at all and unless it can be said that no significant dispute exists regarding it, dismissal should not eventuate\" ( Agai v Liberty Mut. Agency Corp. , 118 AD3d 830, 832; see Guggenheimer v Ginzburg , 43 NY2d 268, 275 ). \"A motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1) may be granted only if the documentary evidence submitted by the moving party utterly refutes the factual allegations of the complaint and conclusively establishes a defense to the claims as a matter of law\" ( MJ Lilly Assoc., LLC v Ovis Creative, LLC , 221 AD3d at 806 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see 533 Park Ave. Realty, LLC v Park Ave. Bldg. & Roofing Supplies, LLC , 156 AD3d 744, 746 ). \"[T]o be considered 'documentary,' evidence must be unambiguous and of undisputed authenticity\" ( Fontanetta v John Doe 1 , 73 AD3d 78, 86 ; see MJ Lilly Assoc., LLC v Ovis Creative, LLC , 221 AD3d at 806). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, accepting the allegations in the amended complaint as true and according the plaintiff the benefit of every favorable inference, the first through third causes of action adequately stated causes of action to recover damages for unpaid wages and overtime compensation ( see Cabrera v Deadwood Constr., Inc. , 226 AD3d 743 , 744), as well as failure to pay spread-of-hours compensation ( see 12 NYCRR 142-2.4). Additionally, the fifth cause of action in the amended complaint, which alleged, inter alia, that the plaintiff's wage statements inaccurately reflected the hours that he worked, stated a cognizable cause of action alleging a violation of Labor Law Â§ 195(3) ( see Cabrera v Deadwood Constr., Inc. , 226 AD3d at 744; Silvers v Jamaica Hosp. , 218 AD3d 817 , 819). Moreover, the evidentiary proof submitted by the defendants did not establish, with respect to the first through third and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint, that a material fact as claimed by the plaintiff is not a fact at all and that no significant dispute exists regarding it ( see Kings Harbor Multicare Ctr. v Townes , 231 AD3d 936 , 938-939). Further, the Supreme Court should have denied dismissal of the first through third and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1). Contrary to the defendants' contention, the plaintiff's pay stubs and handwritten records of his hours worked, the accuracy of which is in dispute, did not utterly refute the plaintiff's factual allegations and conclusively establish a defense to the first through third and fifth causes of action in the amended complaint as a matter of law ( see Sobel v Ansanelli , 98 AD3d 1020, 1022 ). However, the Supreme Court properly granted dismissal of the fourth cause of action in the amended complaint, alleging a failure to provide wage notices in violation of Labor Law Â§ 195(1), pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(1). In support of their motion, the defendants submitted wage notices containing the plaintiff's electronic signature confirming receipt thereof. The wage notices, the authenticity of which the plaintiff did not dispute, utterly refuted the plaintiff's allegations that he never received wage notices as required by the Labor Law ( see Giambrone v Arnone, Lowth, Wilson, Leibowitz, Adriano & Greco , 197 AD3d 459 , 461-462).\n",

      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed. The defendant's contention that he was deprived of his constitutional right to prepare a defense by the Supreme Court's denial of his request for an adjournment is not preserved for appellate review ( see People v Stewart , 222 AD3d 781 , 782; People v Cooper , 192 AD3d 823 , 823; People v Sullivan , 54 AD3d 882, 883 ). In any event, the contention is without merit. \"The decision to grant or deny an adjournment request is committed to the trial court's sound discretion\" ( People v Cooper , 192 AD3d at 823). However, where \"the protection of fundamental rights is involved, the trial court's discretion is 'more narrowly construed'\" ( People v Stewart , 89 AD3d 1044, 1044-1045 , quoting People v Spears , 64 NY2d 698, 700 ). \n",

The defendant's contention that he was deprived of a fair trial due to the Supreme Court's admission of certain testimony pursuant to People v Molineux ( 168 NY 264 ) is without merit. \"Evidence of a crime or bad act may be admissible as evidence in the People's case-in-chief in the trial of another crime when it tends to establish a defendant's (1) intent, (2) motive, (3) knowledge, (4) common scheme or plan, or (5) identity\" ( People v Blackwell , 219 AD3d 619 , 621 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Molineux , 168 NY at 293 ; People v Espinal-Ramos , 225 AD3d 621 , 621-622). Further, \"[i]n certain circumstances, the purposes for which Molineux evidence may be used can include 'completing the narrative of the events charged in the indictment and providing necessary background information'\" ( People v Jones , 206 AD3d 671 , 673, quoting People v Harris , 117 AD3d 847, 854 ; see People v Morris , 21 NY3d 588, 594 ). \"If the proffered evidence is probative of a relevant issue, the court must then engage in a discretionary balancing of its probative value and the need for the evidence against the potential for prejudice to the defendant\" ( People v Bonich , 208 AD3d 679 , 680; see People v Morris , 21 NY3d at 595 ). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the elicited testimony that the defendant initiated a physical altercation with the witness before he showed up at the witness's home with a loaded gun, and that he then fired the gun twice in the witness's direction, was probative of the defendant's motive and intent to use that weapon unlawfully against the witness ( see Penal Law 265.03[1][b]; People v Herrera , 191 AD2d 585 ; People v Richardson , 148 AD2d 476, 477 ). In addition, the testimony regarding the physical altercation provided necessary background information and completed the narrative of events leading up to the charged crimes ( see People v Johnson , 137 AD3d 811, 812-813 ; People v Crevelle , 125 AD3d 995, 999 ). The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in determining that the probative value of this evidence outweighed the potential for prejudice to the defendant, and the limiting instruction given to the jury served to alleviate any potential prejudice resulting from the admission of the evidence ( see People v Blackwell , 219 AD3d at 621; People v Bonich , 208 AD3d at 680). The sentence imposed was not excessive ( see People v Suitte , 90 AD2d 80 ).\n",

      "In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (Lewis J. Lubell, J.), dated August 16, 2022. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint and denied that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was for leave to serve a late notice of claim. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs. In August 2020, the plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries when she slipped and fell on wet carpet at the premises of the defendant, Westchester Medical Center (hereinafter WMC). On October 16, 2020, the plaintiff sent a letter (hereinafter the October 2020 letter) notifying WMC of her fall and her intention to commence an action to recover damages for personal injuries. The October 2020 letter stated, inter alia, the date and the address where the accident occurred. However, the October 2020 letter did not describe the exact location within WMC's premises where the accident occurred. On March 4, 2022, the plaintiff commenced this action against WMC. WMC moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) and (7) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred and for failure to state a cause of action. The plaintiff cross-moved, inter alia, for leave to serve a late notice of claim. In an order dated August 16, 2022, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted WMC's motion and denied that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion. The plaintiff appeals. General Municipal Law Â§ 50-e(1)(a) requires a plaintiff to serve a notice of claim within 90 days after a claim arises as a condition precedent to commencement of a tort action against a municipal corporation. \"'[I]n determining compliance with the requirements of General Municipal Law Â§ 50-e, courts should focus on the purpose served by a Notice of Claim: whether based on the claimant's description municipal authorities can locate the place, fix the time and understand the nature of the accident'\" ( T.N. v City of New York , 227 AD3d 815 , 816, quoting Brown v City of New York , 95 NY2d 389, 393 ; see Behrens v Town of Huntington , 230 AD3d 730 , 731-732). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the plaintiff contends that the October 2020 letter served as a valid notice of claim. However, the October 2020 letter failed to comply with the specificity requirements of General Municipal Law Â§ 50-e(2), as it, inter alia, failed to describe the location of the plaintiff's accident with sufficient specificity, and thus, the October 2020 letter was insufficient to serve as a valid notice of claim ( see Behrens v Town of Huntington , 230 AD3d at 732). Furthermore, even taking into account Executive Order (A. Cuomo) No. 202.8 (9 NYCRR 8.202.8), which tolled certain statutes of limitation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic through November 4, 2020, the plaintiff only had 90 days after the toll was lifted, or until February 2, 2021, to serve a notice of claim, and she failed to do so. Therefore, the plaintiff failed to comply with the condition precedent of General Municipal Law Â§ 50-e(1), as she failed to timely serve a notice of claim. \"In determining whether to grant a petition for leave to serve a late notice of claim or to deem a late notice of claim timely served nunc pro tunc, a court must consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, whether the municipality acquired actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim within 90 days after the claim arose or a reasonable time thereafter, whether the delay would substantially prejudice the municipality in its defense, and whether the petitioner demonstrated a reasonable excuse for the failure to serve a timely notice of claim\" ( Matter of Ionescu v City of New York , 230 AD3d 1143 , 1144; see General Municipal Law Â§ 50-e[5]; Matter of Cleary v Nassau Health Care Corp. , 215 AD3d 958 , 959; Matter of Ibrahim v New York City Tr. Auth. , 202 AD3d 786 , 787). \"Neither the presence nor absence of any one factor is determinative, although it is generally recognized that the question of whether the municipality timely acquired actual knowledge is of great importance\" ( Matter of C.N. v City of New York , 208 AD3d 784 , 785; see I.N. v City of Yonkers , 203 AD3d 721 , 723). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the plaintiff failed to establish that WMC had actual knowledge of the essential facts constituting the claim, failed to provide a reasonable excuse, and failed to establish that it would not substantially prejudice WMC in its defense if the late notice were allowed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in denying that branch of the plaintiff's cross-motion which was for leave to serve a late notice of claim. Moreover, even assuming that the plaintiff satisfied General Municipal Law Â§ 50-e(5), she then had one year and 90 days after the toll on the statute of limitations was lifted, or until February 2, 2022, to commence this action but did not do so until March 4, 2022, 30 days after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. Therefore, the Supreme Court properly granted WMC's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was time-barred. The plaintiff's remaining contentions are improperly raised for the first time on appeal.\n",

      "In an action, inter alia, to recover damages for violation of Judiciary Law Â§ 487, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Orange County (Robert A. Onofry, J.), dated February 8, 2021. The order, insofar as appealed from, (1) granted the separate motions of the defendants Fabricant, Lipman & Frishberg, PLLC, and Neal D. Frishberg and the defendants McCabe & Mack, LLP, and David L. Posner pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them, (2) granted that branch of the motion of the defendants Greenwald Doherty, LLP, and Kevin M.

Bernstein is deemed to be an application for leave to appeal from that portion of the order, and leave to appeal is granted ( see CPLR 5701[c]); and it is further, \n",

      "ORDERED that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from; and it is further, \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the respondents. In 2012, the plaintiff was appointed as a voluntary library trustee of the Town of Chester Library Board of Trustees (hereinafter the Library Board). In 2014, Maureen Jagos, the director of the Town of Chester Library (hereinafter the library), raised a complaint regarding the plaintiff's conduct, which resulted in an investigation conducted by Devora Lindeman of the defendant Greenwald Doherty, LLP (hereinafter Greenwald). Following the investigation, Lindeman issued a report containing her findings and recommendations. According to a report dated July 16, 2014 (hereinafter the Lindeman report), Lindeman found that Jagos's complaints were credible and recommended that the plaintiff be asked to resign or be offered managerial training and that the plaintiff be removed as trustee if she declined to resign or undergo training. In August 2014, the Library Board voted to remove the plaintiff from her position as voluntary library trustee. The plaintiff subsequently retained the defendant Michael H. Sussman of the defendant Sussman & Watkins (hereinafter together the Sussman defendants) to represent her in an action she commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of 42 USC Â§ 1983 . The plaintiff commenced that action against (1) the Town of Chester and its Town Supervisor, Alex Jamieson, represented by the defendant Jonathan M. Bernstein of the defendant Goldberg Segalla (hereinafter together the Goldberg defendants), and (2) the Library Board and its President, Teresa Mallon, represented by the defendant David L. Posner of the defendant McCabe & Mack, LLP (hereinafter together the McCabe defendants). The plaintiff also retained the defendant Neal D. Frishberg of the defendant Fabricant, Lipman, and Frishberg, LLP (hereinafter together the Frishberg defendants), to represent her in an action she commenced in the New York Supreme Court to recover damages for defamation (hereinafter the defamation action). The plaintiff commenced the defamation action against, among others, Jamieson. The plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that Jamieson made false statements to a local newspaper and reporter regarding Lindeman's findings and that Lindeman did not, in actuality, find that Jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible. The plaintiff subsequently discharged the Frishberg defendants as her counsel in the defamation action and proceeded pro se. Thereafter, Jamieson and other defendants separately moved, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the defamation action insofar as asserted against each of them. In an affidavit submitted in support of Jamieson's motion, Lindeman averred, among other things, that the Lindeman report, which accompanied her affidavit and was initialed by her on each page, was authentic. In opposition to Jamieson's motion, the plaintiff asserted, inter alia, that the Lindeman report was a \"forgery\" and that an \"authentic\" report issued by Lindeman existed, which made findings in the plaintiff's favor. The plaintiff did not submit a copy of the alleged authentic report. In an order dated April 3, 2017, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the separate motions of Jamieson and other defendants, in effect, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the defamation action insofar as asserted against each of them. In that order, the court determined that \"[t]he defendants have conclusively established\" that Jamieson's statements regarding the Lindeman report were \"an accurate account of the report of the investigation conducted regarding the plaintiff.\" In August 2020, the plaintiff commenced the instant action, inter alia, to recover damages for violation of Judiciary Law Â§ 487 against the Sussman defendants, the Frishberg defendants, the Goldberg defendants, the McCabe defendants, and Greenwald and its partner, Kevin M. Doherty (hereinafter together the Greenwald defendants). The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the defendants colluded with each other to conceal the alleged authentic version of the Lindeman report and to present a fraudulent report that resulted in the plaintiff's removal as voluntary library trustee. Thereafter, the Frishberg defendants and the McCabe defendants separately moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against each of them on the grounds, inter alia, that the action was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel and that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. In addition, the Greenwald defendants moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint insofar as asserted against them on those grounds and to enjoin the plaintiff \"from filing any further actions relating to her claim that the Lindeman Report exchange in her underlying action was fraudulent.\" In an order dated February 8, 2021, the Supreme Court, among other things, granted the motions of the Frishberg defendants, the McCabe defendants, and the Greenwald defendants, and, sua sponte, in effect, directed the dismissal of the complaint insofar as asserted against the Sussman defendants and the Goldberg defendants. The plaintiff appeals. \"Collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue clearly raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party or those in privity, whether or not the tribunals or causes of action are the same\" ( Reid v Reid , 198 AD3d 993 , 994). \"'The two requirements for its application are: first, the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive in the present action, and second, the party to be precluded must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination'\" ( Cullen v Moschetta , 207 AD3d 699 , 700, quoting Matter of Abady , 22 AD3d 71, 81 ). \"'The party seeking to invoke collateral estoppel has the burden to show the identity of the issues, while the party trying to avoid application of the doctrine must establish the lack of a full and fair opportunity to litigate'\" ( Villaver v Paglinawan , 230 AD3d 533 , 535, quoting Matter of Dunn , 24 NY3d 699, 704 ). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the majority of the plaintiff's allegations in this action were premised on her claim that the Lindeman report was a forgery and that an authentic report existed that made findings in her favor. However, the Supreme Court, in the defamation action, determined that Jamieson's statements regarding the substance of the Lindeman report were accurate, including that Lindeman found that Jagos's complaint against the plaintiff was credible and that the plaintiff should be removed as voluntary library trustee if she declined to resign or receive managerial training. Thus, the moving defendants established that the accuracy of the Lindeman report, which the plaintiff challenges in this action, had been necessarily decided against her in the defamation action ( see Gold v Rothfeld , 220 AD3d 717 , 718; Manko v Gabay , 175 AD3d 484 , 486). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that she lacked a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue ( see Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v McVicar , 203 AD3d 919 , 920; DeMartino v Lomonaco , 155 AD3d 686, 687 ). Furthermore, to the extent the plaintiff raised allegations that were not precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the Supreme Court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. \"'On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), the complaint is to be afforded a liberal construction, the facts alleged are presumed to be true, the plaintiff is afforded the benefit of every favorable inference, and the court is to determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory'\" ( Clevenger v Yuzek , 222 AD3d 931 , 934, quoting Gorbatov v Tsirelman , 155 AD3d 836, 837 ). Pursuant to Judiciary Law Â§ 487, an attorney who is \"guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party\" is liable to the injured party for treble damages ( see Guliyev v Banilov & Asso\n",

      "In a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 6, the maternal grandfather appeals, and the subject child separately appeals, from an order of the Family Court, Suffolk County (Cheryl M. Helfer, Ct. Atty. Ref.), dated June 24, 2024. The order, after a hearing, denied the maternal grandfather's petition for custody of the subject child and dismissed the proceeding. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the facts and in the exercise of discretion, without costs or disbursements, and the matter is remitted to the Family Court, Suffolk County, for a hearing to determine a custody award based upon the best interests of the subject child. The mother and the father have one child together, born in 2009. In 2014 or 2015, the father voluntarily left the child in the care of the mother, who was residing in the maternal grandfather's household. Between 2015 and 2018, the father was incarcerated but maintained some contact with the child. After the father's release, he assisted the mother and the child with moving out of the maternal grandfather's household, but the father continued to live apart from the mother and the child. The maternal grandfather continued assisting the mother in caring for the child and saw the child almost every day. In 2020, the father moved into a house near the maternal grandfather's residence, and the child started staying with the father overnight on a weekly basis. In June 2023, the mother was involved in a car accident and subsequently died from her injuries. On the night of the accident, a paternal uncle drove the child to the maternal grandfather's house, as the father was visiting his fiancÃ©e in North Carolina, where he had been planning to relocate without the child. In July 2023, after the mother's death, the father decided to bring the child to North Carolina with him. After ascertaining the child's wishes, the maternal grandfather commenced this proceeding for custody of the child. After a hearing, in an order dated June 24, 2024, the Family Court denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding, determining that the maternal grandfather failed to establish the existence of extraordinary circumstances. The maternal grandfather and the child separately appeal. \"Pursuant to Domestic Relations Law Â§ 72(2)(a), a grandparent has standing to seek custody of a child where the grandparent demonstrates the existence of extraordinary circumstances, such as 'surrender, abandonment, persisting neglect, unfitness, and unfortunate or involuntary disruption of custody over an extended period of time,' 'or other like extraordinary circumstances'\" ( Matter of Seltzer v Patterson , 193 AD3d 1057 , 1058 [citation omitted], quoting Matter of Bennett v Jeffreys , 40 NY2d 543, 544, 546 ). An \"extended disruption of custody\" between the child and the parent \"shall constitute an extraordinary circumstance\" (Domestic Relations Law Â§ 72[2][a]). \"The statute defines 'extended disruption of custody' as including, but not limited to, 'a prolonged separation of the respondent parent and the child for at least twenty-four continuous months during which the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child and the child resided in the household of the petitioner grandparent or grandparents'\" ( Matter of Mooney v Mooney , 198 AD3d 784 , 785-786, quoting Domestic Relations Law Â§ 72[2][b]). \"However, the statute does not preclude a court from finding the existence of extraordinary circumstances even if the prolonged separation lasted less than 24 months\" ( id. at 786). \"Moreover, lack of contact is not a separate element under th[e] statute, '[r]ather, the quality and quantity of contact between the parent and child are simply factors to be considered in the context of the totality of the circumstances when determining whether the parent voluntarily relinquished care and control of the child, and whether the child actually resided with the grandparents for the required \"prolonged\" period of time'\" ( id. , quoting Matter of Suarez v Williams , 26 NY3d 440, 449 ). \"'Inasmuch as the Family Court is in the best position to evaluate the credibility, temperament, and sincerity of the parties, its determination should be set aside only if it lacks a sound and substantial basis in the record'\" ( Matter of Seltzer v Patterson , 193 AD3d at 1058, quoting Matter of Gonzalez v Pagan , 178 AD3d 1039 , 1040). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, contrary to the Family Court's determination, the maternal grandfather sustained his burden of demonstrating the existence of extraordinary circumstances. The evidence at the hearing established that, even though the father had regular contact and parental access with the child, the maternal grandparents have taken care of the child for most of her life and provided her with stability. Additionally, the father allowed the mother and the maternal grandparents to assume control over, and responsibility for the care of, the child while the father assumed the role of a noncustodial parent, the child has developed a close relationship with her half-siblings and extended family in New York, and the child expressed a desire to continue residing with the maternal grandfather ( see Matter of Tuttle v Worthington , 219 AD3d 1142 , 1145; Matter of Mumford v Milner , 183 AD3d 893 , 895). \n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, since the Family Court did not reach the issue of whether an award of custody to the maternal grandfather was in the best interests of the child, a hearing is required to determine a custody award based upon the best interests of the child ( see Matter of Elisa F. v Daniel D. , 225 AD3d 695 , 697).\n",

The order denied that defendant's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs to the defendants-respondents. The plaintiff's decedent, Debbie Durham, was a passenger in a vehicle owned by Durham and operated by the defendant Roland Tucker (hereinafter the host vehicle) when it collided with a taxi operated by the defendant Thomas Giordano and owned by the defendant Southampton Management, Inc. The collision occurred on Sills Road, which was a two-way street with two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. Tucker was operating the host vehicle straight in the left northbound lane. Giordano exited from a driveway of a premises located on the west side of Sills Road, crossed the two southbound lanes, and collided with the host vehicle as he attempted to make a left turn to travel in a northerly direction. The front driver's side of the host vehicle collided with the front passenger side of the taxi. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, inter alia, to recover damages for personal injuries. Tucker moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him. In an order dated August 2, 2023, the Supreme Court denied Tucker's motion. Tucker appeals. \"There can be more than one proximate cause of an accident, and [g]enerally, it is for the trier of fact to determine the issue of proximate cause\" ( Richardson v Cablevision Sys. Corp. , 173 AD3d 1083 , 1084 [citations and internal quotation marks omitted]; see Saviano v TT of Massapequa, Inc. , 223 AD3d 851 , 852). Therefore, \"'[d]efendants moving for summary judgment in a negligence action arising out of an automobile accident have the burden of establishing, prima facie, that they were not at fault in the happening of the accident'\" ( Woods v Burgos , 220 AD3d 688 , 689, quoting Nesbitt v Gallant , 149 AD3d 763, 763 ; see Rogers v Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , 223 AD3d 689 , 691), \"or that the alleged negligence of another person was the 'sole proximate cause of the accident'\" ( Woods v Burgos , 220 AD3d at 689, quoting Brunson v Korkovilas , 208 AD3d 842, 843). Vehicle and Traffic Law Â§ 1143 provides that \"[t]he driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a roadway from any place other than another roadway shall yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on the roadway to be entered or crossed\" ( see Rogers v Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , 223 AD3d at 691). \"While the driver with the right-of-way is entitled to assume that other drivers will obey the traffic laws requiring them to yield, the driver with the right-of-way also has an obligation to keep a proper lookout and see what can be seen through the reasonable use of his or her senses to avoid colliding with other vehicles\" ( Woods v Burgos , 220 AD3d at 689 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Richardson v Cablevision Sys. Corp. , 173 AD3d at 1085). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, in support of his motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross-claims insofar as asserted against him, Tucker submitted, among other things, transcripts of his and of Giordano's deposition testimony. Tucker failed to establish, prima facie, that he was free from fault in the happening of the collision or that the alleged negligence of Giordano was the sole proximate cause of the collision ( see Tsarenkov v Rosenbaum , 231 AD3d 1184 , 1185; Brunson v Korkovilas , 208 AD3d at 842-843). Specifically, Tucker's own conflicting testimony raised triable issues of fact as to whether he failed to see what there was to be seen and exercised reasonable care to avoid the collision ( see Brunson v Korkovilas , 208 AD3d at 842-843; Fergile v Payne , 202 AD3d 928 , 930). Since Tucker failed to sustain his prima facie burden, we need not consider the sufficiency of the opposition papers ( see Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr. , 64 NY2d 851, 853 ). \n",

Contrary to the defendant's contention, the record demonstrates that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to appeal ( see People v Thomas , 34 NY3d 545 , 559-560; People v Barnes , 210 AD3d 792 , 792-793). The defendant's valid waiver of his right to appeal precludes appellate review of his challenge to the County Court's suppression determination ( see People v Vidal , 233 AD3d 1055 , 1055; People v Barnes , 210 AD3d at 793). By pleading guilty, the defendant forfeited review of any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that did not directly involve the plea-negotiation process and sentence ( see People v Petgen , 55 NY2d 529 , 535 n 3; People v Rodriquez , 194 AD3d 1078 ). To the extent that \n",
      "\n",
      "the defendant contends that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of his pleas or negotiate better pleas under the circumstances, such contention is without merit. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the federal constitution, \"the defendant must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\" and \"that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense\" ( Strickland v Washington , 466 US 668, 687-688 ; see People v Ramroop , _____ AD3d _____, _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01647, *1). In the context of a plea, a defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the defendant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, or that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different ( see People v Ramroop , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01647 ; People v Alexander , 208 AD3d 1247 , 1249). Under the New York Constitution, a defendant must show that he or she was not afforded \"meaningful representation\" ( People v Baldi , 54 NY2d 137, 147 ), which also entails a two-pronged test. The first prong is identical to its federal counterpart ( see People v Galan , 116 AD3d 787, 789 ). The second prong is \"based on the fairness of the process as a whole rather than the impact of counsel's errors on the outcome of the case\" ( People v Parvez , 209 AD3d 885 , 886-887; see People v Caban , 5 NY3d 143, 156 ). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, during the plea colloquy, the defendant stated that he was not a United States citizen, and defense counsel stated, \"I'm sorry, Your Honor. I didn't know that.\" The County Court immediately addressed this by telling the defendant, \"I need to make sure you understand that your plea of guilty may subject you to or result in your deportation, exclusion from the United States, or denied naturalization. And . . . [because] this is a violent felony offense you will be deported as a result of this plea. Do you understand that?\" The defendant replied, \"Yes.\" When the court asked the defendant if he wished to consult with an immigration attorney, he said, \"No.\" Thereafter, the court, among other things, reiterated that the defendant would \"be deported as the result of this crime,\" and the defendant confirmed that he understood. Further, at the end of the plea proceeding, defense counsel indicated that, by that point, defense counsel had discussed the \"certainty of deportation\" with the defendant. Although defense counsel did not advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of his pleas prior to the plea proceeding, it is clear from the record that the County Court repeatedly advised the defendant that he would be deported as a consequence of pleading guilty, and the defendant confirmed that he understood ( see People v Facey , 180 AD3d 927 , 929). Under the circumstances, the defendant was indisputably aware of the possible immigration consequences of pleading guilty before he entered his pleas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the defendant cannot show prejudice resulting from defense counsel's failure to provide that advice prior to the plea proceeding ( see People v Ramroop , _____ AD3d _____, 2025 NY Slip Op 01647 ; People v Facey , 180 AD3d at 929; see also People v Singh , 231 AD3d 749 , 750). Additionally, the defendant failed to demonstrate that an incentive to remain in the United States would have made it rational to reject a favorable plea offer ( see People v Facey , 180 AD3d at 929).\n",

      "In an action to recover damages for negligence, the defendant appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Alexander M. Tisch, J.), dated November 22, 2022. The order denied the defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant, Poly Prep Country Day School (hereinafter Poly Prep), pursuant to the Child Victims Act (hereinafter the CVA), which created a revival window for previously time-barred childhood sexual abuse claims ( see CPLR 214-g). Poly Prep moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) to dismiss the complaint as time-barred. In an order dated November 22, 2022, the Supreme Court denied the motion. Poly Prep appeals. \"On a motion to dismiss a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(5) as barred by the applicable statute of limitations, the defendant bears the initial burden of demonstrating, prima facie, that the time within which to commence the cause of action has expired\" ( Rubin v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 227 AD3d 741 , 742 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Schearer v Fitzgerald , 217 AD3d 980 , 981). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Poly Prep, which argued that the CVA violates the Due Process Clause of the New York Constitution, failed to meet its burden. \"CPLR 214-g, enacted as part of the CVA, provides a revival window for 'civil claims or causes of action alleging intentional or negligent acts or omissions that seek to recover for injuries suffered as a result of conduct which would constitute sex crimes, which conduct was committed against a child less than 18 years of age, for which the statute of limitations had already run'\" ( Feaster v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 227 AD3d 668 , 669, quoting S.H. v Diocese of Brooklyn , 205 AD3d 180 , 184; see Spira v National Council of Young Israel , 231 AD3d 987 , 988; Forbes v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 220 AD3d 750 , 751). \"[A] claim-revival statute will satisfy the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution if it was enacted as a reasonable response in order to remedy an injustice\" ( Matter of World Trade Ctr. Lower Manhattan Disaster Site Litig. , 30 NY3d 377, 400 ). Contrary to Poly Prep's contention, the revival of civil claims and causes of action pursuant to the CVA was a reasonable response to remedy the injustice to child sexual assault survivors caused by application of the relevant statute of limitations ( see Spira v National Council of Young Israel , 231 AD3d at 988; Feaster v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 227 AD3d at 669-670; Forbes v Poly Prep Country Day Sch. , 220 AD3d at 752; Schearer v Fitzgerald , 217 AD3d at 982-983). Poly Prep's remaining contention is without merit. \n",

      "In an action, inter alia, for a judgment declaring that certain beneficiary designations are null and void, the plaintiff appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (Paul M. Hensley, J.), dated May 30, 2023. The order granted the defendants' motion pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint. \n",
      "\n",
      "ORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the cause of action for a judgment declaring that certain beneficiary designations are null and void, and substituting therefor a provision denying that branch of the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff. The plaintiff is the daughter of Selma J. Rauch (hereinafter the decedent), who died in November 2022. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant Laura Rauch, the plaintiff's sister-in-law, and the defendants Jonathan Rauch, Jesse Rauch, and Jordan Rauch, Laura's sons, alleging, inter alia, that in 2016 and 2017, the defendants improperly influenced the decedent to name them as the beneficiaries of two accounts that contained an approximate total sum of $470,000. The plaintiff alleged that the beneficiary designations are void by reason of the defendants' undue influence over the decedent and the decedent's lack of capacity when the beneficiary designations were executed. The defendants moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint on the ground, among others, that it failed to state a cause of action. In opposition to the motion, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit in which she made statements to supplement the causes of action alleged in the complaint. In an order dated May 30, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the defendants' motion. The plaintiff appeals. \"On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), a court must accept the facts as alleged in the complaint as true, accord plaintiffs the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory\" ( Reaves v New York City Dept. of Educ. , 218 AD3d 697 , 698 [internal quotation marks omitted]; see Connaughton v Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. , 29 NY3d 137, 141 ). \"'Whether the complaint will later survive a motion for summary judgment, or whether the plaintiff will ultimately be able to prove its claims, of course, plays no part in the determination of a prediscovery CPLR 3211 motion to dismiss'\" ( Perlov v Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J. , 189 AD3d 1624 , 1626, quoting Shaya B. Pac., LLC v Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, LLP , 38 AD3d 34, 38 ). Where a cause of action is based upon, inter alia, fraud, breach of trust, or undue influence, the circumstances constituting the wrong shall be stated in detail ( see CPLR 3016[b]). \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the Supreme Court should have considered the plaintiff's affidavit to remedy any defects in the complaint when it assessed the defendants' motion ( see Leon v Martinez , 84 NY2d 83, 88 ; Hountenbous v Fordune Assn., Inc. , 200 AD3d 662 , 664). Contrary to the defendants' contention, the affidavit and the complaint alleged with sufficient detail facts to support a claim that the changes to the beneficiary designations of the decedent's accounts are void by virtue of undue influence exercised by the defendants over the decedent or the decedent's incapacity ( see Matter of Tognino , 87 AD3d 1153, 1155 ). \n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the court erred in granting that branch of the defendants' motion which was pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the cause of action for a judgment declaring that the beneficiary designations are null and void. However, the Supreme Court correctly determined that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently state causes of action alleging unjust enrichment ( see Nasca v Greene , 216 AD3d 648 , 650; Beaman v Awaye Realty Mgt., LLC , 176 AD3d 1025 , 1025) and to impose a constructive trust ( see Seidenfeld v Zaltz , 162 AD3d 929 , 936), as the plaintiff failed to allege that she conferred any benefit upon the defendants. Similarly, the court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for money had and received, as she failed to allege that the defendants received money belonging to her ( see Pacella v RSA Consultants, Inc. , 164 AD3d 806 , 808; Lebovits v Bassman , 120 AD3d 1198, 1199-1200 ).\n",
